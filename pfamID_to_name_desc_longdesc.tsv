PF00043	GST_C	Glutathione S-transferase, C-terminal domain	GST conjugates reduced glutathione to a variety of targets including S-crystallin from squid, the eukaryotic elongation factor 1-gamma, the HSP26 family of stress-related proteins and auxin-regulated proteins in plants.  Stringent starvation proteins in E. coli are also included in the alignment but are not known to have GST activity.                                The glutathione molecule binds in a cleft between N and  C-terminal domains. The catalytically important residues are proposed  to reside in the N-terminal domain [1].

PF00067	p450	Cytochrome P450	Cytochrome P450s are haem-thiolate proteins [6] involved in the oxidative degradation of various compounds. They are particularly well known for their role in the degradation of environmental toxins and mutagens. They can be divided into 4 classes, according to the method by which electrons from NAD(P)H are delivered to the catalytic site. Sequence conservation is relatively low within the family - there are only 3 absolutely conserved residues - but their general topography and structural fold are highly conserved. The conserved core is composed of a coil termed the 'meander', a four-helix bundle, helices J and K, and two sets of beta-sheets. These constitute the haem-binding loop (with an absolutely conserved cysteine that serves as the 5th ligand for the haem iron), the proton-transfer groove and the absolutely conserved EXXR motif in helix K. While prokaryotic P450s are soluble proteins, most eukaryotic P450s are associated with microsomal membranes. their general enzymatic function is to catalyse regiospecific and stereospecific oxidation of non-activated hydrocarbons at physiological temperatures [6].	y

PF00080	Sod_Cu	Copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SODC)	superoxide dismutases (SODs) catalyse the conversion of superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen.  Three evolutionarily distinct families of SODs are known, of which the copper/zinc-binding  family is one.

PF00300	His_Phos_1	Histidine phosphatase superfamily (branch 1)	The histidine phosphatase superfamily is so named because catalysis centres on a conserved His residue that is transiently phosphorylated during the catalytic cycle.  Other conserved residues contribute to a 'phosphate pocket' and interact with the phospho group of substrate before, during and after its transfer to the His residue. Structure and sequence analyses show that different families contribute different additional residues to the 'phosphate pocket' and, more surprisingly, differ in the position, in sequence and in three dimensions, of a catalytically essential acidic residue.

The larger branch 1 contains a wide variety of catalytic functions, the best known being fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase (found in a bifunctional protein with 2-phosphofructokinase) and cofactor-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase.  The latter is an unusual example of a mutase activity in the superfamily: the vast majority of members appear to be phosphatases.

The superfamily may be divided into two main branches.The smaller branch 2 contains predominantly eukaryotic proteins.  The catalytic functions in members include phytase, glucose-1-phosphatase and multiple inositol polyphosphate phosphatase.

Positions 14 (Asp-21), 34 (Arg-35), 39 (Asp-40), 42 (Glu-43) and 110 (Arg-87) [SNase numbering in parentheses] are thought to be involved in substrate-binding and catalysis.	m
PF00574	CLP_protease	Clp protease	The Clp protease has an active site catalytic triad. In E. coli Clp protease, ser-111, his-136 and asp-185 form the catalytic triad.

PF00614	PLDc	Phospholipase D Active site motif	Phosphatidylcholine-hydrolysing phospholipase D (PLD) isoforms are activated by ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs). PLD produces phosphatidic acid from phosphatidylcholine, which may be essential for the formation of certain types of transport vesicles or may be constitutive vesicular transport to signal transduction pathways.  PC-hydrolysing PLD is a homologue of cardiolipin synthase, phosphatidylserine synthase, bacterial PLDs, and viral proteins. Each of these appears to possess a domain duplication which is apparent by the presence of two motifs containing well-conserved histidine, lysine, and/or asparagine residues which may contribute to the active site. aspartic acid.  An E. coli endonuclease (nuc) and similar proteins appear to be PLD homologues but possess only one of these motifs. The profile contained here represents only the putative active site regions, since an accurate multiple alignment of the repeat units has not been achieved.	y

It facilitates the transfer of an acetyl group from Acetyl Coenzyme A on to a wide range of arylamine, N-hydroxyarylamines and hydrazines. Acetylation of these compounds generally results in inactivation. NAT is found in many species from Mycobacteria (M. tuberculosis, M. smegmatis etc) to man.

Interestingly the histidines are not well conserved, and there is a lack of experimental  evidence to support peptidase activity as a general  property of this family. There also appear to be instances of this domain outside of the HSP70-actin superfamily (e.g. Swiss:Q9ZM49).	m

A subset of SET domains have been called PR domains.  These domains are divergent in sequence from other SET domains, but also appear to mediate protein-protein interaction [3].  The SET domain consists of two regions known as SET-N and SET-C.  SET-C forms an unusual and conserved knot-like structure of probably functional importance.

The family contains a number of different subsets including a family of proteins comprising archaeal lumazine and riboflavin synthases, type I lumazine synthases, and the eubacterial type II lumazine synthases [1]. It has been established that lumazine synthase catalyses the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of riboflavin in plants and microorganisms.  The type I lumazine synthases area active in pentameric or icosahedral quaternary assemblies, whereas the type II are decameric [2].  Brucella, a bacterial genus that causes brucellosis, and other Rhizobiales have an atypical riboflavin metabolic pathway. Brucella spp code for both a type-I and a type-II lumazine synthase, and it has been shown that at least one of these two has to be present in order for Brucella to be viable, showing that in the case of Brucella flavin metabolism is implicated in bacterial virulence [3].	y

The role of dihydrouridine in tRNA is currently unknown, but may increase conformational flexibility of the tRNA. It is likely that different family members have different substrate specificities, which may overlap.  Dus 1 (Swiss:Q9HGN6) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae acts on pre-tRNA-Phe, while Dus 2 (Swiss:P53720) acts on pre-tRNA-Tyr and pre-tRNA-Leu.  Dus 1 is active as a single subunit, requiring NADPH or NADH, and is stimulated by the presence of FAD [1].

The Cys residue within  the DHHC domain forms a stable acyl intermediate and transfers the  acyl chain to the Cys residues of a target protein [2][3]. Some  proteins containing a DHHC domain include Drosophila DNZ1 protein  [4], Mouse Abl-philin 2 (Aph2) protein [5], Mammalian ZDHHC9 [6],  Yeast ankyrin repeat-containing protein AKR1 [7], Yeast Erf2  protein [8], and Arabidopsis thaliana tip growth defective 1 [9].	m

This is catalysed by a pair of C-terminal deaminase fold domains in the protein [3], where the active site is formed by the dimeric interface of two monomeric units [3].

Members of this family occur all across nature and are involved in a variety of processes. For instance, in Nereis diversicolor Swiss:P80255 binds Cadmium so as to protect the organism from toxicity ([3]). However Hemerythrin is classically described as Oxygen-binding through two attached Fe2+ ions. And the bacterial Swiss:Q7WX96 is a regulator of response to NO, which suggests yet another set-up for its metal ligands ([4]). In Staphylococcus aureus P72360 has been noted to be important when the organism switches to living in environments with low oxygen concentrations ([4]); perhaps this protein acts as an oxygen store or scavenger.	u

Sequence conservation in this superfamily primarily involves three motifs that centre around conserved cysteine, histidine, and aspartate residues that form the catalytic triad in the structurally characterised transglutaminase, the human blood clotting factor XIIIa' [1]. On the basis of the experimentally demonstrated activity of the Methanobacterium phage pseudomurein endoisopeptidase [2], it is proposed that many, if not all, microbial homologues of the transglutaminases are proteases and that the eukaryotic transglutaminases have evolved from an ancestral protease. [3]	y

PF01861	DUF43	Branched-chain polyamine synthase A C-terminal domain	This domain is found in the C terminus of N(4)-bis(aminopropyl)spermidine synthase (EC:2.5.1.128, also known as Branched-chain polyamine synthase A, BpsA) from hyperthermophiles [1] and in uncharacterised proteins from bacteria and archaea.	u
PF01862	PvlArgDC	Pyruvoyl-dependent arginine decarboxylase (PvlArgDC)	Methanococcus jannaschii contains homologues of most genes required for spermidine polyamine biosynthesis. Yet genomes from neither this organism nor any other euryarchaeon have orthologues of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate- dependent ornithine or arginine decarboxylase genes, required to produce putrescine. Instead,these organisms have a new class of arginine decarboxylase (PvlArgDC) formed by the self-cleavage of a proenzyme into a 5-kDa subunit and a 12-kDa subunit that contains a reactive pyruvoyl group. Although this extremely thermostable enzyme has no significant sequence similarity to previously characterised proteins, conserved active site residues are similar to those of the pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase enzyme, and its subunits form a similar (alpha-beta)(3) complex. Homologues of PvlArgDC are found in several bacterial genomes, including those of Chlamydia spp., which have no agmatine ureohydrolase enzyme to convert agmatine (decarboxylated arginine) into putrescine. In these intracellular pathogens, PvlArgDC may function analogously to pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase; the cells are proposed to import arginine and export agmatine, increasing the pH and affecting the host cell's metabolism. Phylogenetic analysis of Pvl- ArgDC proteins suggests that this gene has been recruited from the euryarchaeal polyamine biosynthetic pathway to function as a degradative enzyme in bacteria [1].	y

Swiss:Q16439 is a candidate tumour suppressor gene [1]. DPH2 from yeast Swiss:P32461 [2], which confers resistance to diphtheria toxin has been found to be involved in diphthamide synthesis. Diphtheria toxin inhibits eukaryotic protein synthesis by ADP-ribosylating diphthamide, a post-translationally modified histidine residue present in EF2. Diphthamide synthase is evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes. Diphthamide is a post-translationally modified histidine residue found on archaeal and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF-2) [3].	y

PF01883	FeS_assembly_P	Iron-sulfur cluster assembly protein	This family has an alpha/beta topology, with 13 conserved hydrophobic residues at its core and a putative active site containing a highly conserved cysteine [1]. Members of this family are involved in a range of physiological functions. The family includes PaaJ (PhaH) Swiss:O84984 from Pseudomonas putida. PaaJ forms a complex with PaaG (PhaF) Swiss:O84982, PaaI (PhaG) Swiss:O84983 and PaaK (PhaI) Swiss:O84985, which hydroxylates phenylacetic acid to 2-hydroxyphenylacetic acid [2]. It also includes PaaD Swiss:P76080 from Escherichia coli, a member of a multicomponent oxygenase involved in phenylacetyl-CoA hydroxylation [3]. Furthermore, several members of this family are shown to be involved in iron-sulfur (FeS) cluster assembly. Iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters are inorganic co-factors that are are able to transfer electrons and act as catalysts [5]. They are involved in diverse cellular processes including cellular respiration, DNA replication and repair, antibiotic resistance, and dinitrogen fixation [6]. The biogenesis of such clusters from elemental iron and sulfur is an enzymatic process that requires a set of specialised proteins. Proteins containing this domain include the chloroplast protein HCF101 (high chlorophyll fluorescence 101), Swiss:Q6STH5, which has been described as an essential and specific factor for assembly of [4Fe-4S]-cluster-containing protein complexes such as the membrane complex Photosystem I (PSI) and the heterodimeric FTR (ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase) complex [5] and is involved in the assembly of [4Fe-4S] clusters and their transfer to apoproteins [4]. The mature HCF101 protein contains this domain at the N-terminal as well as eight cysteine residues along the sequence.  All cysteine residues are conserved among higher plants, but of the two cysteine residues located in this domain only Cys128 is highly conserved and is present in the highly conserved P-loop domain of the plant HCF101 (CKGGVGKS) [5]. SufT protein from Staphylococcus aureus is composed of this domain solely and is shown to be involved in the maturation of FeS proteins [6]. Given all this data, it is hypothesised that this domain might play a role in FeS cluster assembly.	y

The structure of proteins in this family is similar to that of a bacterial fluorinating enzyme [1]. S-adenosyl-l-methionine hydroxide adenosyltransferases utilises a rigorously conserved amino acid side chain triad (Asp-Arg-His) which may have a role in activating water to hydroxide ion [2]. This family used to be known as DUF62.	y
PF01888	CbiD	CbiD	CbiD is essential for cobalamin biosynthesis in both S. typhimurium and B. megaterium, no functional role has been ascribed to the protein. The CbiD protein has a putative S-AdoMet binding site. It is possible that CbiD might have the same role as CobF in undertaking the C-1 methylation and deacylation reactions required during the ring contraction process [1].	y
PF01890	CbiG_C	Cobalamin synthesis G C-terminus	Members of this family are involved in cobalamin synthesis.  The gene encoded by Swiss:P72862 has been designated cbiH but in fact represents a fusion between cbiH and cbiG. As other multi-functional proteins involved in cobalamin biosynthesis catalyse adjacent steps in the pathway, including CysG, CobL (CbiET), CobIJ and CobA-HemD, it is therefore possible that CbiG catalyses a reaction step adjacent to CbiH. In the anaerobic pathway such a step could be the formation of a gamma lactone, which is thought to help to mediate the anaerobic ring contraction process [1]. Within the cobalamin synthesis pathway CbiG catalyses the both the opening of the lactone ring and the extrusion of the two-carbon fragment of cobalt-precorrin-5A from C-20 and its associated methyl group (deacylation) to give cobalt-precorrin-5B [2]. This family is the C-terminal region, and the mid- and N-termival parts are conserved independently in other families.	y

Diphthamide synthase is evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes. Diphthamide is a post-translationally modified histidine residue found on archaeal and eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF-2) [1]. In some members of this family e.g. Swiss:Q12429, this domain is associated with Pfam:PF01042. The enzyme classification is EC:6.3.1.14.	y
PF01903	CbiX	CbiX	The function of CbiX is uncertain, however it is found in cobalamin biosynthesis operons and so may have a related function. Some CbiX proteins contain a striking histidine-rich region at their C-terminus, which suggests that it might be involved in metal chelation [1].	y

The first step in the post-translational formation of hypusine is catalysed by the enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase (DS) EC:1.1.1.249. The modified version of eIF-5A, and DS, are required for eukaryotic cell proliferation [1].	y

PF01923	Cob_adeno_trans	Cobalamin adenosyltransferase	Cobalamin adenosyltransferase This family contains the gene products of PduO and EutT which are both cobalamin adenosyltransferases. PduO is a protein with ATP:cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase activity. The main role of this protein is the conversion of inactive cobalamins to AdoCbl for 1,2-propanediol degradation [1].The EutT enzyme appears to be an adenosyl transferase, converting CNB12 to AdoB12 [2].	y
PF01926	MMR_HSR1	50S ribosome-binding GTPase	The full-length GTPase protein is required for the complete activity of the protein of interacting with the 50S ribosome and binding of both adenine and guanine nucleotides, with a preference for guanine nucleotide.	m
PF01931	NTPase_I-T	Protein of unknown function DUF84	NTPase_I-T is a family of NTPases with supreme activity against ITP and XTP. Active site analysis and structure comparison of YjjX strongly suggested that it is an NTP binding protein with nucleoside triphosphatase activity. YjjX exhibits a mixed alpha-beta fold [1,2].	y
PF01936	NYN	NYN domain	These domains are found in the eukaryotic proteins typified by the Nedd4-binding protein 1 and the bacterial YacP-like proteins (Nedd4-BP1, YacP nucleases; NYN domains). The NYN domain shares a common protein fold with two other previously characterized groups of nucleases, namely the PIN (PilT N-terminal) and FLAP/5' --> 3' exonuclease superfamilies. These proteins share a common set of 4 acidic conserved residues that are predicted to constitute their active site. Based on the conservation of the acidic residues and structural elements Aravind and colleagues suggest that PIN and NYN domains are likely to bind only a single metal ion, unlike the FLAP/5' --> 3' exonuclease superfamily, which binds two metal ions.  Based on conserved gene neighborhoods Aravind and colleagues infer that the bacterial members are likely to be components of the processome/degradsome that process tRNAs or ribosomal RNAs.	m

S-Adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) occupies a central role in the metabolism of all cells. The biological roles of AdoMet include acting as the primary methyl group donor, as a precursor to the polyamines, and as a progenitor of a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical. S-Adenosylmethionine synthetase catalyses the only known route of AdoMet biosynthesis. The synthetic process occurs in a unique reaction in which the complete triphosphate chain is displaced from ATP and a sulfonium ion formed. MATs from various organisms contain ~400-amino acid polypeptide chains [1]. 	y

The chorismate pyruvate-lyase encoded by sll1797 in cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. , has been shown to catalyze the initial and essential step in plastoquinone biosynthesis [2]. In E. coli , the chorismate lyase (UbiC) catalyses the conversion of chorismate to p-hydroxybenzoate and pyruvate in the biosynthesis of ubiquinone as well [3].	u

PF01980	TrmO	tRNA-methyltransferase O	This family includes members such as TrmO (tRNA-methyltransferase O) also known as YaeB, which contains a single-sheeted beta-barrel structure. TrmO is an AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase responsible for m6t6A formation [1]. Its human homolog, is responsible for formation of m6t6A37 in cytoplasmic tRNASer. Lack of TrmO decreases attenuation activity of the thr operon, indicating that N6 methylation of m6t6A37 ensures efficient decoding of ACY codons [2]. In bacteria and eukaryotes, TrmO has a C-terminal domain containing the conserved DPRxxY motif. Where the Asp194 and Arg196 in this motif of E. coli TrmO are necessary for N6-methylation. However, no archaeal YaeB has a C-terminal domain containing the DPRxxY motif that is conserved in bacterial and mammalian TrmO homologs [1].	u

Biochemical assays showed that aTrm56 forms a dimer and prefers the L-shaped tRNA to the lambda form as its substrate [1] [2].  aTrm56 consists of the SPOUT domain, which contains the characteristic deep trefoil knot for AdoMet binding, and a unique C-terminal beta-hairpin [3].	y

It catalyses the GTP-dependent successive addition of multiple gamma-linked L-glutamates to the L-lactyl phosphodiester of 7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavin (F420-0). This reaction produces polyglutamated F420 derivatives.  GTP + F420-0 + n L-glutamate -> GDP + phosphate + F420-n	y

The enzyme is found in both eukaryotes and archaebacteria [2]	y
PF02006	PPS_PS	Phosphopantothenate/pantothenate synthetase	This family of archaeal proteins includes pantothenate synthetase from Methanosarcina mazei and 4-phosphopantoate--beta-alanine ligase (phosphopantothenate synthetase) from Pyrococcus kodakaraensis. Pantothenate synthetase catalyses the condensation of pantoate with beta-alanine in an ATP-dependent and ADP-producing reaction [1]. 4-phosphopantoate--beta-alanine ligase catalyses the conversion of (R)-4-phosphopantoate and beta-alanine to 4'-phosphopantothenate in the CoA biosynthesis pathway. It cannot use (R)-pantoate as substrate and thus does not display pantothenate synthetase activity [2].	y

PF02075	RuvC	Crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease RuvC	This entry includes endodeoxyribonucleases found in bacteria, such as RuvC. RuvC is a small protein of about 20 kD. It requires and binds a magnesium ion. The structure of E. coli RuvC is a 3-layer alpha-beta sandwich containing a 5-stranded beta-sheet sandwiched between 5 alpha-helices [2]. The Escherichia coli RuvC gene is involved in DNA repair and in the late step of RecE and RecF pathway recombination [1]. RuvC protein (EC:3.1.22.4) cleaves cruciform junctions, which are formed by the extrusion of inverted repeat sequences from a super-coiled plasmid and which are structurally analogous to Holliday junctions, by introducing nicks into strands with the same polarity. The nicks leave a 5'terminal phosphate and a 3'terminal hydroxyl group which are ligated by E. coli or Bacteriophage T4 DNA ligases. Analysis of the cleavage sites suggests that DNA topology rather than a particular sequence determines the cleavage site. RuvC protein also cleaves Holliday junctions that are formed between gapped circular and linear duplex DNA by the function of RecA protein. The active form of RuvC protein is a dimer. This is mechanistically suited for an endonuclease involved in swapping DNA strands at the crossover junctions. It is inferred that RuvC protein is an endonuclease that resolves Holliday structures in vivo [1].	m

PF02137	A_deamin	Adenosine-deaminase (editase) domain	Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) can deaminate adenosine to form inosine. In long double-stranded RNA, this process is non-specific; it occurs site-specifically in RNA transcripts. The former is important in defence against viruses, whereas the latter may affect splicing or untranslated regions. They are primarily nuclear proteins, but a longer isoform of ADAR1 is found predominantly in the cytoplasm. ADARs are derived from the Tad1-like tRNA deaminases that are present across eukaryotes. These in turn belong to the nucleotide/nucleic acid deaminase superfamily and  are characterized by a distinct insert between the two conserved cysteines that are involved in binding zinc [2].	m

PF02171	Piwi	Piwi domain	This domain is found in the protein Piwi and its relatives.  The function of this domain is the dsRNA guided hydrolysis of ssRNA. Determination of the crystal structure of Argonaute reveals that PIWI is an RNase H domain, and identifies Argonaute as Slicer, the enzyme that cleaves mRNA in the RNAi RISC complex [2].  In addition, Mg+2 dependence and production of 3'-OH and 5' phosphate products are shared characteristics of RNaseH and RISC. The PIWI domain core has a tertiary structure belonging to the RNase H family of enzymes.  RNase H fold proteins all have a five-stranded mixed beta-sheet surrounded by helices. By analogy to RNase H enzymes which cleave single-stranded RNA guided by the DNA strand in an RNA/DNA hybrid, the PIWI domain can be inferred to cleave single-stranded RNA, for example mRNA, guided by double stranded siRNA.	y

PF02580	Tyr_Deacylase	D-Tyr-tRNA(Tyr) deacylase	This family comprises of several D-Tyr-tRNA(Tyr) deacylase proteins.  Cell growth inhibition by several d-amino acids can be explained by an in vivo production of d-aminoacyl-tRNA molecules. Escherichia coli and yeast cells express an enzyme, d-Tyr-tRNA(Tyr) deacylase, capable of recycling such d-aminoacyl-tRNA molecules into free tRNA and d-amino acid. Accordingly, upon inactivation of the genes of the above deacylases, the toxicity of d-amino acids increases.  Orthologues of the deacylase are found in many cells [1].The D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD) enzyme is homodimeric with two active sites located at the dimeric interface. Each active site carries an invariant Gly-cisPro dipeptide motif in each monomer. The interaction between the dipeptide motifs from each monomer ensures substrate stereospecificity. This family also includes a subclass of DTDs which is present in Chordata and harbors a Gly-transPro motif. The cis to trans switch is the key to Animal DTDs (ATD) gaining of L-chiral selectivity. This 'gain of function' through relaxation of substrate chiral specificity underlies ATD's capability of correcting the error in tRNA selection [2].	y
PF02581	TMP-TENI	Thiamine monophosphate synthase	Thiamine monophosphate synthase (TMP) (EC:2.5.1.3) catalyses the substitution of the pyrophosphate of 2-methyl-4-amino-5- hydroxymethylpyrimidine pyrophosphate by 4-methyl-5- (beta-hydroxyethyl)thiazole phosphate to yield thiamine phosphate [1]. This Pfam family also includes the regulatory protein TENI (Swiss:P25053), a protein from Bacillus subtilis that regulates the production of several extracellular enzymes by reducing alkaline protease production [2]. While TenI shows high sequence similarity with thiamin phosphate synthase, the purified protein has no thiamin phosphate synthase activity. Instead, it is a thiazole tautomerase [3].	y

PF02586	SRAP	SOS response associated peptidase (SRAP)	The SRAP family functions as a DNA-associated autoproteolytic switch that recruits diverse repair enzymes onto DNA damage. We propose that the human protein Q96FZ2:UniProtKB, the eukaryotic member of the SRAP family, which has been recently shown to bind specifically to DNA with 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxycytosine, is a sensor for these oxidized bases generated by the TET (tetrahedral aminopeptidase of the M42 family) enzymes from methylcytosine. Hence, its autoproteolytic activity might help it act as a switch that recruits DNA repair enzymes to remove these oxidized methylcytosine species as part of the DNA demethylation pathway downstream of the TET enzymes.	m

The nitrate reductase enzyme, EC:1.7.99.4 catalyse the conversion of nitrite to nitrate via the reduction of an acceptor.                  The nitrate reductase enzyme is composed of three subunits [1].         Nitrate is the most widely used alternative electron acceptor after oxygen [1]. This family also now contains the family TorD, a family of cytoplasmic chaperone proteins; like many prokaryotic molybdoenzymes, the TMAO reductase (TorA) of Escherichia coli requires the insertion of a bis(molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide) molybdenum (bis(MGD)Mo) cofactor in its catalytic site to be active and translocated to the periplasm. The TorD chaperone increases apoTorA activation up to four-fold, allowing maturation of most of the apoprotein.

PF02673	BacA	Bacitracin resistance protein BacA	Bacitracin resistance protein (BacA) is a putative undecaprenol kinase. BacA confers resistance to bacitracin, probably by phosphorylation of undecaprenol [1]. More recent studies show that BacA has undecaprenyl pyrophosphate phosphatase activity. Undecaprenyl phosphate is a key lipid intermediate involved in the synthesis of various bacterial cell wall polymers. Bacitracin, a mixture of related cyclic polypeptide antibiotics, is used to treat surface tissue infections. Its primary mode of action is the inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis through sequestration of the essential carrier lipid undecaprenyl pyrophosphate, C55-PP, resulting in the loss of cell integrity and lysis [2,3]. The characteristic phosphatase sequence-motif in this family is likely to be the PGxSRSGG, compared with the PSGH of the PAP family of phosphatases [3].	y
PF02675	AdoMet_dc	S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 	This family contains several S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase proteins from bacterial and archaebacterial species.

QueH contains conserved cysteines that could be involved in the coordination of a Fe/S center in a similar fashion to what has been identified in QueG. No cobalamin was identified associated with recombinant QueH protein, indicating that the reduction activity is independent from cobalamin [1].	u

A tomato homologue of human Pirin has been found to be induced during programmed cell death [2]. Human Pirin interacts with Bcl-3 and NFI [3] and hence is probably involved in the regulation of DNA transcription and replication.

MurC, MurD, Mure and MurF catalyse consecutive steps in the synthesis of peptidoglycan.  Peptidoglycan consists of a sheet of two sugar derivatives, with one of these N-acetylmuramic acid attaching to a small pentapeptide.  The pentapeptide is is made of L-alanine, D-glutamic acid, Meso-diaminopimelic acid and D-alanyl alanine.

Major royal jelly  proteins make up around 90% of larval jelly proteins.   This family also the sequence-related yellow protein of drosophila  which controls pigmentation of the adult cuticle and larval mouth  parts.	y
PF03023	MurJ	Lipid II flippase MurJ	Peptidoglycan synthesis (PG) biosynthesis involves the formation of peptidoglycan precursor lipid II (undecaprenyl-pyrophosphate-linked N-acetyl glucosamine-N-acetyl muramic acid-pentapeptide) on the cytosolic face of the cell membrane. Lipid II is then translocated across the membrane and its glycopeptide moiety becomes incorporated into the growing cell wall mesh. MviN, renamed as MurJ, is a lipid II flippase essential for cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis [1, 2]. MurJ belongs to the MVF (mouse virulence factor) family of MOP superfamily transporters, which also includes the MATE (multidrug and toxic compound extrusion) transporter and eukaryotic OLF (oligosaccharidyl-lipid flippase) families. In addition to the canonical MOP transporter core consisting of 12 transmembrane helices (TMs), MurJ has two additional C-terminal TMs (13 and 14) of unknown function. Structural analysis indicates that the N lobe (TMs 1Ã¢â‚¬â€œ6) and C lobe (TMs 7Ã¢â‚¬â€œ14) are arranged in an inward-facing N-shape conformation, rather than the outward-facing V-shape conformation observed in all existing MATE transporter structures. Furthermore, a hydrophobic groove is formed by two C-terminal transmembrane helices, which leads into a large central cavity that is mostly cationic.  Mutagenesis studies, revealed a solvent-exposed cavity that is essential for function. Mutation of conserved residues (Ser17, Arg18, Arg24, Arg52, and Arg255) at the proximal site failed to complement MurJ function, consistent with the idea that these residues are important for recognizing the diphosphate and/or sugar moieties of lipid II. It has also been suggested that the chloride ion in the central cavity and a zinc ion at the beginning of TM 7 might be functionally important [3].	s
PF03029	ATP_bind_1	Conserved hypothetical ATP binding protein	Members of this family are found in a range of archaea and eukaryotes and have hypothesised ATP binding activity.	u
PF03030	H_PPase	Inorganic H+ pyrophosphatase	The H+ pyrophosphatase is an transmembrane proton pump involved in establishing the H+ electrochemical potential difference between the vacuole lumen and the cell cytosol. Vacuolar-type H(+)-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatases have long been considered to be restricted to plants and to a few species of photo-trophic bacteria. However, in recent investigations, these pyrophosphatases have been found in organisms as disparate as thermophilic Archaea and parasitic protists [1].	y

PF03051	Peptidase_C1_2	Peptidase C1-like family	This family is closely related to the Peptidase_C1 family  Pfam:PF00112, containing several prokaryotic and eukaryotic aminopeptidases and bleomycin hydrolases.	m
PF03059	NAS	Nicotianamine synthase protein	Nicotianamine synthase EC:2.5.1.43 catalyses the trimerisation of S-adenosylmethionine to yield one molecule of nicotianamine. Nicotianamine has an important role in plant iron uptake mechanisms.  Plants adopt two strategies (termed I and II) of iron acquisition.  Strategy I is adopted by all higher plants except graminaceous plants, which adopt strategy II [1,2]. In strategy I plants, the role of nicotianamine is not fully determined: possible roles include the formation of more stable complexes with ferrous than with ferric ion, which might serve as a sensor of the physiological status of iron within a plant, or which might be involved in the transport of iron [1]. In strategy II (graminaceous) plants, nicotianamine is the key intermediate (and nicotianamine synthase the key enzyme) in the synthesis of the mugineic family (the only known family in plants) of phytosiderophores. Phytosiderophores are iron chelators whose secretion by the roots is greatly increased in instances of iron deficiency [2]. The 3D structures of five example NAS from Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus reveal the monomer to consist of a five-helical bundle N-terminal domain on top of a classic Rossmann fold C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domain is unique to the NAS family, whereas the C-terminal domain is homologous to the class I family of SAM-dependent methyltransferases. An active site is created at the interface of the two domains, at the rim of a large cavity that corresponds to the nucleotide binding site such as is found in other proteins adopting a Rossmann fold [3].	y
PF03060	NMO	Nitronate monooxygenase	Nitronate monooxygenase (NMO), formerly referred to as 2-nitropropane dioxygenase (NPD) (EC:1.13.11.32), is an FMN-dependent enzyme that uses molecular oxygen to oxidize (anionic) alkyl nitronates and, in the case of the enzyme from Neurospora crassa, (neutral) nitroalkanes to the corresponding carbonyl compounds and nitrite. Previously classified as 2-nitropropane dioxygenase [1,2,3], but it is now recognized that this was the result of the slow ionization of nitroalkanes to their nitronate (anionic) forms [4]. The enzymes from the fungus Neurospora crassa and the yeast Williopsis saturnus var. mrakii (formerly classified as Hansenula mrakii) contain non-covalently bound FMN as the cofactor. Active towards linear alkyl nitronates of lengths between 2 and 6 carbon atoms and, with lower activity, towards propyl-2-nitronate. The enzyme from N. crassa can also utilize neutral nitroalkanes, but with lower activity. One atom of oxygen is incorporated into the carbonyl group of the aldehyde product. The reaction appears to involve the formation of an enzyme-bound nitronate radical and an a-peroxynitroethane species, which then decomposes, either in the active site of the enzyme or after release, to acetaldehyde and nitrite.	y
PF03061	4HBT	Thioesterase superfamily	This family contains a wide variety of enzymes, principally thioesterases. This family includes 4HBT (EC 3.1.2.23) which catalyses the final step in the  biosynthesis of 4-hydroxybenzoate from 4-chlorobenzoate in the soil dwelling microbe Pseudomonas CBS-3. This family includes various cytosolic long-chain acyl-CoA  thioester hydrolases. Long-chain acyl-CoA hydrolases hydrolyse palmitoyl-CoA to CoA and palmitate, they also catalyse the hydrolysis of other  long chain fatty acyl-CoA thioesters.	y
PF03062	MBOAT	MBOAT, membrane-bound O-acyltransferase family	The MBOAT (membrane bound O-acyl transferase) family of membrane proteins contains a variety of acyltransferase enzymes. A conserved histidine has been suggested to be the active site residue [1].	y
PF03063	Prismane	Prismane/CO dehydrogenase family	This family includes both hybrid-cluster proteins and the beta chain of carbon monoxide dehydrogenase. The hybrid-cluster proteins contain two Fe/S centres - a [4Fe-4S] cubane cluster, and a hybrid [4Fe-2S-2O] cluster.  The physiological role of this protein is as yet unknown, although a role in nitrate/nitrite respiration has been suggested [1]. The prismane protein from Escherichia coli was shown to contain hydroxylamine reductase activity (NH2OH + 2e + 2 H+ -> NH3 + H2O). This activity is rather low. Hydroxylamine reductase activity was also found in CO-dehydrogenase in which the active site Ni was replaced by Fe [2].  The CO dehydrogenase contains a Ni-3Fe-2S-3O centre.	y
PF03065	Glyco_hydro_57	Glycosyl hydrolase family 57	This family includes alpha-amylase (EC:3.2.1.1), 4--glucanotransferase (EC:2.4.1.-) and amylopullulanase enzymes.	s
PF03067	LPMO_10	Lytic polysaccharide mono-oxygenase, cellulose-degrading	This domain is found associated with a wide variety of cellulose binding domains. This is a family of two very closely related proteins that together act as both a C1- and a C4-oxidising lytic polysaccharide mono-oxygenase [2], degrading cellulose. This domain is also found in baculoviral spheroidins and spindolins, protein of unknown function.	y
PF03068	PAD	Protein-arginine deiminase (PAD)	Members of this family are found in mammals. In the presence of calcium ions, PAD enzymes EC:3.5.3.15 catalyse the post-translational modification reaction responsible for the formation of citrulline residues: Protein L-arginine + H2O <=> Protein L-citrulline + NH3. Several types are recognised (and included in the family) on the basis of molecular mass, substrate specificity, and tissue localisation. The expression of type I PAD is known to be under the control of oestrogen [3].	y
PF03069	FmdA_AmdA	Acetamidase/Formamidase family	This family includes amidohydrolases of formamide EC:3.5.1.49 and acetamide. Swiss:Q50228 forms a homotrimer suggesting all the members of this family also do.	y
PF03070	TENA_THI-4	TENA/THI-4/PQQC family	Members of this family are found in all the three major phyla of life: archaebacteria, eubacteria, and eukaryotes. In Bacillus subtilis, TENA is one of a number of proteins that enhance the expression of extracellular enzymes, such as alkaline protease, neutral protease and levansucrase [1].  The THI-4 protein, which is involved in thiamine biosynthesis, is also a member of this family. The C-terminal part of these proteins consistently show significant sequence similarity to TENA proteins. This similarity was first noted with the Neurospora crassa THI-4 [2]. This family includes bacterial coenzyme PQQ synthesis protein C or PQQC proteins.  Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) is the prosthetic group of several bacterial enzymes,including methanol dehydrogenase of methylotrophs and the glucose dehydrogenase of a number of bacteria [3]. PQQC has been found to be required in the synthesis of PQQ but its function is unclear.  The exact molecular function of members of this family is uncertain.	y
PF03074	GCS	Glutamate-cysteine ligase	This family represents the catalytic subunit of glutamate-cysteine ligase (E.C. 6.3.2.2), also known as gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (GCS).                          This enzyme catalyses the rate limiting step in the biosynthesis of glutathione. The eukaryotic enzyme is a dimer of a heavy chain and a light chain with all the catalytic activity exhibited by the heavy chain (this family).	y
PF03079	ARD	ARD/ARD' family	The two acireductone dioxygenase enzymes (ARD and ARD', previously known as E-2 and E-2') from Klebsiella pneumoniae share the same amino acid sequence  Swiss:Q9ZFE7, but bind different metal ions: ARD binds Ni2+, ARD' binds Fe2+. ARD and ARD' can be experimentally interconverted by removal of the bound metal ion and reconstitution with the appropriate metal ion.  The two enzymes share the same substrate, 1,2-dihydroxy-3-keto-5-(methylthio)pentene, but yield different products. ARD' yields the alpha-keto precursor of methionine (and formate), thus forming part of the ubiquitous methionine salvage  pathway that converts 5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA) to methionine. This pathway is responsible for the tight control of the concentration of MTA, which is a powerful inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis and transmethylation reactions [1,2]. ARD yields methylthiopropanoate, carbon monoxide and formate, and thus prevents the conversion of MTA to methionine. The role of the ARD catalysed reaction is unclear: methylthiopropanoate is cytotoxic, and carbon monoxide can activate guanylyl cyclase, leading to increased intracellular cGMP levels [1,2]. This family also contains other members, whose functions are not well characterised.	y
PF03088	Str_synth	Strictosidine synthase	Strictosidine synthase (E.C. 4.3.3.2) is a key enzyme in alkaloid  biosynthesis.  It catalyses the condensation of tryptamine with  secologanin to form strictosidine.	y
PF03098	An_peroxidase	Animal haem peroxidase		y
PF03099	BPL_LplA_LipB	Biotin/lipoate A/B protein ligase family	This family includes biotin protein ligase, lipoate-protein ligase A and B.  Biotin is covalently attached at the active site of certain enzymes that transfer carbon dioxide from bicarbonate to organic acids to form cellular metabolites.  Biotin protein ligase (BPL) is the enzyme responsible for attaching biotin to a specific lysine at the active site of biotin enzymes. Each organism probably has only one BPL.  Biotin attachment is a two step reaction that results in the formation of an amide linkage between the carboxyl group of biotin and the epsilon-amino group of the modified lysine [2]. Lipoate-protein ligase A (LPLA) catalyses the formation of an amide linkage between lipoic acid and a specific lysine residue in lipoate dependent enzymes [3]. The unusual biosynthesis pathway of lipoic acid is mechanistically intertwined with attachment of the cofactor [5].	y
PF03102	NeuB	NeuB family	NeuB is the prokaryotic N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) synthase. It catalyses the direct formation of Neu5Ac (the most common sialic acid) by condensation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc). This reaction has only been observed in prokaryotes; eukaryotes synthesise the 9-phosphate form, Neu5Ac-9-P, and utilise ManNAc-6-P instead of ManNAc. Such eukaryotic enzymes are not present in this family [1]. This family also contains SpsE spore coat polysaccharide biosynthesis proteins.	y
PF03116	NQR2_RnfD_RnfE	NQR2, RnfD, RnfE family	This family of bacterial proteins includes a sodium-translocating  NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (i.e. a respiration linked sodium  pump). In Vibrio cholerae, it negatively regulates the expression of virulence factors through inhibiting  (by an unknown mechanism) the transcription of the transcriptional activator ToxT [1]. The family also includes proteins involved in nitrogen fixation, RnfD and RnfE. The similarity of these proteins to NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductases was previously noted [2].	y
PF03130	HEAT_PBS	PBS lyase HEAT-like repeat	This family contains a short bi-helical repeat that is related to Pfam:PF02985. Cyanobacteria and red algae harvest light energy using macromolecular complexes known as phycobilisomes (PBS), peripherally attached to the photosynthetic membrane. The major components of PBS are the phycobiliproteins. These heterodimeric proteins are covalently attached to phycobilins: open-chain tetrapyrrole chromophores, which function as the photosynthetic light-harvesting pigments. Phycobiliproteins differ in sequence and in the nature and number of attached phycobilins to each of their subunits. This family includes the lyase enzymes that specifically attach particular phycobilins to apophycobiliprotein subunits. The most comprehensively studied of these is the CpcE/F lyase Swiss:P31967 Swiss:P31968, which attaches phycocyanobilin (PCB) to the alpha subunit of apophycocyanin [1]. Similarly, MpeU/V attaches phycoerythrobilin to phycoerythrin II, while CpeY/Z is thought to be involved in phycoerythrobilin (PEB) attachment to phycoerythrin (PE) I (PEs I and II differ in sequence and in the number of attached molecules of PEB: PE I has five, PE II has six) [2]. All the reactions of the above lyases involve an apoprotein cysteine SH addition to a terminal delta 3,3'-double bond.  Such a reaction is not possible in the case of phycoviolobilin (PVB), the phycobilin of alpha-phycoerythrocyanin (alpha-PEC). It is thought that in this case, PCB, not PVB, is first added to apo-alpha-PEC, and is then isomerised to PVB. The addition reaction has been shown to occur in the presence of either of the components of alpha-PEC-PVB lyase PecE or PecF (or both). The isomerisation reaction occurs only when both PecE and PecF components are present, i.e. the PecE/F phycobiliprotein lyase is also a phycobilin isomerase [3]. Another member of this family is the NblB protein Swiss:Q9Z3G5, whose similarity to the phycobiliprotein lyases was previously noted [4].  This constitutively expressed protein is not known to have any lyase activity. It is thought to be involved in the coordination of PBS degradation with environmental nutrient limitation. It has been suggested that the similarity of NblB to the phycobiliprotein lyases is due to the ability to bind tetrapyrrole phycobilins via the common repeated motif [4].	s
PF03133	TTL	Tubulin-tyrosine ligase family	Tubulins and microtubules are subjected to several post-translational modifications of which the reversible detyrosination/tyrosination of the carboxy-terminal end of most alpha-tubulins has been extensively analysed. This modification cycle involves a specific carboxypeptidase and the activity of the tubulin-tyrosine ligase (TTL) [2]. The true physiological function of TTL has so far not been established. Tubulin-tyrosine ligase (TTL) catalyses the ATP-dependent post-translational addition of a tyrosine to the carboxy terminal end of detyrosinated alpha-tubulin. In normally cycling cells, the tyrosinated form of tubulin predominates. However, in breast cancer cells, the detyrosinated form frequently predominates, with a correlation to tumour aggressiveness [3]. On the other hand, 3-nitrotyrosine has been shown to be incorporated, by TTL, into the carboxy terminal end of detyrosinated alpha-tubulin. This reaction is not reversible by the carboxypeptidase enzyme. Cells cultured in 3-nitrotyrosine rich medium showed evidence of altered microtubule structure and function, including altered cell morphology, epithelial barrier dysfunction, and apoptosis [4].  Bacterial homologs of TTL are predicted to form peptide tags. Some of these are fused to a 2-oxoglutarate Fe(II)-dependent  dioxygenase domain [6].	y
PF03136	Pup_ligase	Pup-ligase protein	Pupylation is a novel protein modification system found in some bacteria [1]. This family of proteins are the enzyme that can conjugate proteins of the Pup family to lysine residues in target proteins marking them for degradation. The archetypal protein in this family is PafA (proteasome accessory factor) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis [2]. It has been suggested that these proteins are related to gamma-glutamyl-cysteine synthetases [1].	y
PF03139	AnfG_VnfG	Vanadium/alternative nitrogenase delta subunit	The nitrogenase complex EC:1.18.6.1 catalyses the conversion of molecular nitrogen to ammonia (nitrogen fixation) as follows: 8 reduced ferredoxin + 8 H(+) + N(2) + 16 ATP <=> 8 oxidised ferredoxin + 2 NH(3) + 16 ADP + 16 phosphate. The complex is hexameric, consisting of 2 alpha, 2 beta, and 2 delta subunits. This family represents the delta subunit of a group of nitrogenases that do not utilise molybdenum (Mo) as a cofactor, but instead use either vanadium (V nitrogenases), or iron (alternative nitrogenases). V nitrogenases are encoded by vnf operons, and alternative nitrogenases by anf operons. The delta subunits are VnfG and AnfG, respectively.	y
PF03141	Methyltransf_29	Putative S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent methyltransferase	This family is a putative S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferase [1,2].	y
PF03150	CCP_MauG	Di-haem cytochrome c peroxidase	This is a family of distinct cytochrome c peroxidases (CCPs) that contain two haem groups. Similar to other cytochrome c peroxidases, they reduce hydrogen peroxide to water using c-type haem as an oxidisable substrate. However, since they possess two, instead of one, haem prosthetic groups, bacterial CCPs reduce hydrogen peroxide without the need to generate semi-stable free radicals. The two haem groups have significantly different redox potentials. The high potential (+320 mV) haem feeds electrons from electron shuttle proteins to the low potential (-330 mV) haem, where peroxide is reduced (indeed, the low potential site is known as the peroxidatic site) [1]. The CCP protein itself is structured into two domains, each containing one c-type haem group, with a calcium-binding site at the domain interface. This family also includes MauG proteins, whose similarity to di-haem CCP was previously recognised [2].	y
PF03152	UFD1	Ubiquitin fusion degradation protein UFD1	Post-translational ubiquitin-protein conjugates are recognised for degradation by the ubiquitin fusion degradation (UFD) pathway. Several proteins involved in this pathway have been identified [1]. This family includes UFD1, a 40kD protein that is essential for vegetative cell viability [1]. The human UFD1 gene is expressed at high levels during embryogenesis, especially in the eyes and in the inner ear primordia and is thought to be important in the determination of ectoderm-derived structures, including neural crest cells. In addition, this gene is deleted in the CATCH-22 (cardiac defects, abnormal facies, thymic hypoplasia, cleft palate and hypocalcaemia with deletions on chromosome 22) syndrome. This clinical syndrome is associated with a variety of developmental defects, all characterised by microdeletions on 22q11.2. Two such developmental defects are the DiGeorge syndrome OMIM:188400, and the velo-cardio- facial syndrome OMIM:145410. Several of the abnormalities associated  with these conditions are thought to be due to defective neural crest cell differentiation [2].	y
PF03155	Alg6_Alg8	ALG6, ALG8 glycosyltransferase family	N-linked (asparagine-linked) glycosylation of proteins is mediated by a highly conserved pathway in eukaryotes, in which a lipid  (dolichol phosphate)-linked oligosaccharide is assembled at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane prior to the transfer of the oligosaccharide moiety to the target asparagine residues. This oligosaccharide is composed of Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2). The addition of the three glucose residues is the final series of steps in the synthesis of the oligosaccharide precursor. Alg6 transfers the first glucose residue, and Alg8 transfers the second one [1]. In the human alg6 gene, a C->T transition, which causes Ala333 to be replaced with Val, has been identified as the cause of a congenital disorder of glycosylation, designated as type Ic OMIM:603147 [2].	y
PF03159	XRN_N	XRN 5'-3' exonuclease N-terminus	This family aligns residues towards the N-terminus of several proteins with multiple functions. The members of this family all appear to possess 5'-3' exonuclease activity EC:3.1.11.-. Thus, the aligned region may be necessary for 5' to 3' exonuclease function. The family also contains several Xrn1 and Xrn2 proteins. The 5'-3' exoribonucleases Xrn1p and Xrn2p/Rat1p function in the degradation and processing of several classes of RNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Xrn1p is the main enzyme catalysing cytoplasmic mRNA degradation in multiple decay pathways, whereas Xrn2p/Rat1p functions in the processing of rRNAs and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) in the nucleus [3].	m

PF03167	UDG	Uracil DNA glycosylase superfamily		s
PF03170	BcsB	Bacterial cellulose synthase subunit	This family includes bacterial proteins involved in cellulose synthesis. Cellulose synthesis has been identified in several bacteria. In Agrobacterium tumefaciens, for instance, cellulose has a pathogenic role: it allows the bacteria to bind tightly to their host plant cells.  While several enzymatic steps are involved in cellulose synthesis, potentially the only step unique to this pathway is that catalysed by cellulose synthase. This enzyme is a multi subunit complex. This family encodes a subunit that is thought to bind the positive effector cyclic di-GMP. This subunit is found in several different bacterial cellulose synthase enzymes. The first recognised sequence for this subunit is BcsB. In the AcsII cellulose synthase, this subunit and the subunit corresponding to BcsA are found in the same protein. Indeed, this alignment only includes the C-terminal half of the AcsAII synthase (Swiss:Q59167), which corresponds to BcsB.	s
PF03171	2OG-FeII_Oxy	2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase superfamily	This family contains members of the 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase superfamily [1].  This family includes the C-terminal of prolyl 4-hydroxylase  alpha subunit.  The holoenzyme has the activity EC:1.14.11.2  catalysing the reaction: Procollagen L-proline + 2-oxoglutarate + O2 <=> procollagen trans- 4-hydroxy-L-proline + succinate + CO2.  The full enzyme consists of a alpha2 beta2 complex with the alpha subunit contributing most of the parts of the active site [3]. The family also includes lysyl hydrolases, isopenicillin synthases and AlkB.	y
PF03174	CHB_HEX_C	Chitobiase/beta-hexosaminidase C-terminal domain	This short domain represents the C terminal domain in chitobiases and beta-hexosaminidases EC:3.2.1.52. It is composed of a beta sandwich structure [1]. The function of this domain is unknown.	y
PF03178	CPSF_A	CPSF A subunit region	This family includes a region that lies towards the C-terminus of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) A (160 kDa) subunit. CPSF is involved in mRNA polyadenylation and binds the AAUAAA conserved sequence in pre-mRNA. CPSF has also been found to be necessary for splicing of single-intron pre-mRNAs [1]. The function of the aligned region is unknown but may be involved in RNA/DNA binding.	m
PF03184	DDE_1	DDE superfamily endonuclease	This family of proteins are related to Pfam:PF00665 and are probably endonucleases of the DDE superfamily. Transposase proteins are necessary for efficient DNA transposition. This domain is a member of the DDE superfamily, which contain three carboxylate residues that are believed to be responsible for coordinating metal ions needed for catalysis. The catalytic activity of this enzyme involves DNA cleavage at a specific site followed by a strand transfer reaction. Interestingly this family also includes the CENP-B protein. This domain in that protein appears to have lost the metal binding residues and is unlikely to have endonuclease activity. Centromere Protein B (CENP-B) is a DNA-binding protein localised to the centromere.	y
PF03186	CobD_Cbib	CobD/Cbib protein	This family includes CobD proteins from a number of bacteria, in Salmonella this protein is called Cbib. Salmonella CobD is a different protein [1]. This protein is involved in cobalamin biosynthesis and is probably an enzyme responsible for the conversion of adenosylcobyric acid to adenosylcobinamide or adenosylcobinamide phosphate [1].	y
PF03193	RsgA_GTPase	RsgA GTPase	RsgA (also known as EngC and YjeQ) represents a protein family whose members are broadly conserved in bacteria and are indispensable for growth. The GTPase domain of RsgA is very similar to several P-loop GTPases, but differs in having a circular permutation of the GTPase structure described by a G4-G1-G3 pattern [1].	y
PF03198	Glyco_hydro_72	Glucanosyltransferase	This is a family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored beta(1-3)glucanosyltransferases. The active site residues in the Aspergillus fumigatus example Swiss:B0XT72 are the two glutamate residues at 160 and 261 [3].	s
PF03200	Glyco_hydro_63	Glycosyl hydrolase family 63 C-terminal domain	This is a family of eukaryotic enzymes belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 63. They catalyse the specific  cleavage of the non-reducing terminal glucose residue from Glc(3)Man(9)GlcNAc(2). Mannosyl oligosaccharide glucosidase EC:3.2.1.106 is the first enzyme in the N-linked oligosaccharide processing pathway. This family represents the C-terminal catalytic domain [1].	s

It also contains several other eukaryotic putative proteins with similarity to GILT [3]. The aligned region contains three conserved cysteine residues. In addition, the two GILT sequences possess a C-X(2)-C motif that is shared by some of the other sequences in the family. This motif is thought to be associated with disulphide bond reduction.	y
PF03232	COQ7	Ubiquinone biosynthesis protein COQ7	Members of this family contain two repeats of about 90 amino acids, that contains two conserved motifs. One of these DXEXXH may be part of an enzyme active site.	y

PF03254	XG_FTase	Xyloglucan fucosyltransferase	Plant cell walls are crucial for development, signal transduction, and disease resistance in plants. Cell walls are made of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and pectins. Xyloglucan (XG), the principal load-bearing hemicellulose of dicotyledonous plants, has a terminal fucosyl residue. This fucosyltransferase adds this residue [1].	y

PF03330	DPBB_1	Lytic transglycolase	Rare lipoprotein A (RlpA) contains a conserved region that has the double-psi beta-barrel (DPBB) fold [3,4]. The function of RlpA is not well understood, but it has been shown to act as a prc mutant suppressor in Escherichia coli [1]. The DPBB fold is often an enzymatic domain. The members of this family are quite diverse, and if catalytic this family may contain several different functions.  Another example of this domain is found in the N terminus of pollen allergen. Recent studies show that the full-length RlpA protein from Pseudomonas Aeruginosa is an outer membrane protein that is a lytic transglycolase with specificity for peptidoglycan lacking stem peptides. Residue D157 in UniProtKB:Q9X6V6 is critical for lytic activity [5].	y
PF03331	LpxC	UDP-3-O-acyl N-acetylglycosamine deacetylase	The enzymes in this family catalyse the second step in the biosynthetic pathway for lipid A.	y
PF03332	PMM	Eukaryotic phosphomannomutase	This enzyme EC:5.4.2.8 is involved in the synthesis of the GDP-mannose and dolichol-phosphate-mannose required for a number of critical mannosyl transfer reactions.	y
PF03345	DDOST_48kD	Oligosaccharyltransferase 48 kDa subunit beta	Members of this family are involved in asparagine-linked protein glycosylation. In particular, dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase (DDOST), also known as oligosaccharyltransferase EC:2.4.1.119, transfers the high-mannose sugar GlcNAc(2)-Man(9)-Glc(3) from a dolichol-linked donor to an asparagine acceptor in a consensus Asn-X-Ser/Thr motif. In most eukaryotes, the DDOST complex is composed of three subunits, which in humans are described as a 48kD subunit, ribophorin I, and ribophorin II. However, the yeast DDOST appears to consist of six subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta). The yeast beta subunit is a 45kD polypeptide, previously discovered as the Wbp1 protein, with known sequence similarity to the human 48kD subunit and the other orthologues. This family includes the 48kD-like subunits from several eukaryotes; it also includes the yeast DDOST beta subunit Wbp1.	s

PF03403	PAF-AH_p_II	Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase, isoform II	Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) is a subfamily of phospholipases A2, responsible for inactivation of platelet-activating factor through cleavage of an acetyl group. Three known PAF-AHs are the brain heterotrimeric PAF-AH Ib, whose catalytic beta and gamma subunits are aligned in Pfam:PF02266, the extracellular, plasma PAF-AH (pPAF-AH), and the intracellular PAF-AH isoform II (PAF-AH II).

PF03407	Nucleotid_trans	Nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferase	Proteins in this family have been been predicted to be nucleotide-diphospho-sugar transferases.	y
PF03412	Peptidase_C39	Peptidase C39 family	Lantibiotic and non-lantibiotic bacteriocins are synthesised as precursor peptides containing N-terminal extensions (leader peptides) which are cleaved off during maturation. Most non-lantibiotics and also some lantibiotics have leader peptides of the so-called double-glycine type. These leader peptides share consensus sequences and also a common processing site with two conserved glycine residues in positions -1 and -2. The double- glycine-type leader peptides are unrelated to the N-terminal signal sequences which direct proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane via the sec pathway. Their processing sites are also different from typical signal peptidase cleavage sites, suggesting that a different processing enzyme is involved. Peptide bacteriocins are exported across the cytoplasmic membrane by a dedicated ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. The ABC transporter is the maturation protease  and its proteolytic domain resides in the N-terminal part of the protein [1].  This peptidase domain is found in a wide range of ABC transporters, however the presumed catalytic cysteine and histidine are not conserved in all members of this family.	m

PF03432	Relaxase	Relaxase/Mobilisation nuclease domain 	Relaxases/mobilisation proteins are required for the horizontal transfer of genetic information contained on plasmids that occurs during bacterial conjugation. The relaxase, in conjunction with several auxiliary proteins, forms the relaxation complex or relaxosome. Relaxases nick duplex DNA in a specific manner by catalysing  trans-esterification[1].    	y
PF03435	Sacchrp_dh_NADP	Saccharopine dehydrogenase NADP binding domain	This family contains the NADP binding domain of saccharopine dehydrogenase. In some organisms this enzyme is found as a bifunctional polypeptide with lysine ketoglutarate reductase. The saccharopine dehydrogenase can also function as a saccharopine reductase.	y
PF03443	Glyco_hydro_61	Glycosyl hydrolase family 61	Although weak endoglucanase activity has been demonstrated in several members of this family [1-3], they lack the clustered conserved catalytic acidic amino acids present in most glycoside hydrolases.  Many members of this family lack measurable cellulase activity on their own, but enhance the activity of other cellulolytic enzymes.  They are therefore unlikely to be true glycoside hydrolases [4]. The subsrate-binding surface of this family is a flat Ig-like fold [5].	s
PF03454	MoeA_C	MoeA C-terminal region (domain IV)	This domain is found in  proteins involved in biosynthesis of molybdopterin cofactor however the exact molecular function of this domain is uncertain. The structure of this domain is known [1] and forms an incomplete beta barrel.	y
PF03457	HA	Helicase associated domain	This short domain is found in multiple copies in bacterial helicase proteins. The domain is predicted to contain 3 alpha helices.  The function of this domain may be to bind nucleic acid.	m
PF03473	MOSC	MOSC domain	The MOSC (MOCO sulfurase C-terminal) domain is a  superfamily of beta-strand-rich domains identified in the molybdenum cofactor sulfurase and several other proteins from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. These MOSC domains contain an absolutely conserved cysteine and occur either as stand-alone forms such as Swiss:P32157, or fused to other domains such as NifS-like catalytic domain in Molybdenum cofactor sulfurase. The MOSC domain is predicted to be a sulfur-carrier domain that receives sulfur abstracted by the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent NifS-like enzymes, on its conserved cysteine, and delivers it for the formation of diverse sulfur-metal clusters.	y
PF03478	DUF295	Protein of unknown function (DUF295)	This domain is found in plant proteins of unknown function. It can be found in association with F-box domain Pfam:PF00646.	u

PF03492	Methyltransf_7	SAM dependent carboxyl methyltransferase	This family of plant methyltransferases contains enzymes that act on a variety of substrates including salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and 7-Methylxanthine. Caffeine is synthesised through sequential three-step methylation of xanthine derivatives at positions 7-N, 3-N, and 1-N.  The protein 7-methylxanthine methyltransferase (designated as CaMXMT) catalyses the second step to produce theobromine [1].	y
PF03496	ADPrib_exo_Tox	ADP-ribosyltransferase exoenzyme	This is a family of bacterial and viral bi-glutamic acid ADP-ribosyltransferases, where, in Swiss:Q93Q17, E403 is the catalytic residue and E401 contributes to the transfer of ADP-ribose to the target protein.

The family includes gra-ORF27 Swiss:Q9ZA32 product that probably functions at an early step, most likely as a dTDP-4-keto-6- deoxyglucose-2,3-dehydratase [1]. Its homologues include dnmT from the daunorubicin biosynthetic gene cluster in S. peucetius [2], a similar gene from the daunomycin biosynthetic cluster in Streptomyces sp. strain C5 Swiss:Q53880 [3] , eryBVI from the erythromycin cluster in S. erythraea and snoH from the nogalamycin cluster in S. nogalater. The proteins in this family are composed of two copies of a 200 amino acid long unit that may be a structural domain.	y
PF03567	Sulfotransfer_2	Sulfotransferase family	This family includes a variety of sulfotransferase enzymes. Chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase catalyses the transfer of sulfate to position 6 of the N-acetylgalactosamine residue of chondroitin. This family also includes Heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase (HS2ST) and Heparan sulfate 6-sulfotransferase (HS6ST).  Heparan sulfate (HS) is a co-receptor for a number of growth factors, morphogens, and adhesion proteins. HS biosynthetic modifications may determine the strength and outcome of HS-ligand interactions. Mice that lack HS2ST undergo developmental failure only after midgestation,the most dramatic effect being the complete failure of kidney development [1].  Heparan sulphate 6- O -sulfotransferase (HS6ST) catalyses the transfer of sulphate from adenosine 3'-phosphate, 5'-phosphosulphate to the 6th position of the N -sulphoglucosamine residue in heparan sulphate [2].	y

The central domain is the catalytic domain, which binds a phosphate ion that is proximal the the highly conserved Glu.  The arrangement of the phosphate and the glutamate is thought to cause nucleophilic attack on the anomeric carbon atom [1].  The catalytic domain also forms the majority of the dimerisation interface.	s
PF03639	Glyco_hydro_81	Glycosyl hydrolase family 81 N-terminal domain	Family of eukaryotic beta-1,3-glucanases. Within the Aspergillus fumigatus protein Swiss:Q9UVV0 two perfectly conserved Glu residues (E550 or E554) have been proposed as putative nucleophiles of the active site of the Engl1 endoglucanase, while the proton donor would be D475.

Resolution of HJs is mediated by a diverse group of DNA structure specific endonucleases known as Holliday junction resolvases (HJR) [1]. This entry is specific for RuvX also known as YqgF a family of nucleases which resolves the Holliday junction intermediates in genetic recombination[2-3]. Studies carried out in M. tuberculosis, have shown that YqgF/RuvX is a genuine HJR analogous to RuvC from E. coli. Furthermore, a single cysteine present in M. tuberculosis RuvX was found to be required for disulfide-bond mediated intermolecular dimerization and HJ resolution activity, suggesting that M. tuberculosis RuvX has adapted its YqgF protein to function like a typical RuvC family HJR [1].	m

PF03702	AnmK	Anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid kinase	Anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid kinase catalyses the specific phosphorylation of 1,6-anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid (anhMurNAc) with the simultaneous cleavage of the 1,6-anhydro ring, generating MurNAc-6-P. It is also required for the utilization of anhMurNAc, either imported from the medium, or derived from its own cell wall murein, and in so doing plays a role in cell wall recycling [1,2].	y
PF03706	LPG_synthase_TM	Lysylphosphatidylglycerol synthase TM region	LPG_synthase_TM is the N-terminal region of this family of bacterial phosphatidylglycerol lysyltransferases. The function of the family is to add lysyl groups to membrane lipids, and this region is the transmembrane domain of 7xTMs. In order to counteract attack by membrane-damaging external cationic antimicrobial molecules - from host immune systems, bacteriocins, defencins, etc - bacteria modify their anionic membrane phosphatidylglycerol with positively-charged L-lysine; this results in repulsion of the foreign cationic peptides [1,2,3].	y

These proteins  adenylate and deadenylate glutamine synthases: ATP + {L-Glutamate:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming)} = Diphosphate + Adenylyl-{L-Glutamate:Ammonia ligase  (ADP-forming)}.

PF03734	YkuD	L,D-transpeptidase catalytic domain	This family of proteins are found in a range of bacteria. It has been shown that this domain can act as an L,D-transpeptidase that gives rise to an alternative pathway for peptidoglycan cross-linking [1].  This gives bacteria resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics that inhibit PBPs which usually carry out the cross-linking reaction.  The conserved region contains a conserved histidine and cysteine, with the cysteine thought to be an active site residue.  Several members of this family contain peptidoglycan binding domains.  The molecular structure of YkuD protein shows this domain has a novel tertiary fold consisting of a beta-sandwich with two mixed sheets, one containing five strands and the other, six strands. The two beta-sheets form a cradle capped by an alpha-helix. This family was formerly called the ErfK/YbiS/YcfS/YnhG family, but is now named after the first protein of known structure.	y

RraA acts as a trans-acting modulator of RNA turnover, binding essential endonuclease RNase E and inhibiting RNA processing [2]. RraA-like proteins seem to contain aldolase and/or decarboxylase activity either in place of or in addition to the RNase E inhibitor functions [1].	y
PF03738	GSP_synth	Glutathionylspermidine synthase preATP-grasp	This region contains the Glutathionylspermidine synthase enzymatic activity EC:6.3.1.8. This is the C-terminal region in bi-enzymes such as Swiss:P43675. Glutathionylspermidine (GSP) synthetases of Trypanosomatidae and Escherichia coli couple hydrolysis of ATP (to ADP and Pi) with formation of an amide bond between spermidine and the glycine carboxylate of glutathione (gamma-Glu-Cys-Gly). In the pathogenic trypanosomatids, this reaction is the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of the antioxidant metabolite, trypanothione (N1,N8-bis-(glutathionyl)spermidine), and is a target for drug design [1]. This region, the pre-ATP grasp region, probably carries the substrate-binding site [2].	y

This domain is found in chaplins ChpA-C (coelicolor hydrophobic aerial) proteins. ChpA-C contain a canonical C-terminal sortase signal, which is recognized by sortase enzymes that covalently couple their substrates to the peptidoglycan present in the cell wall. Indeed, direct evidence for sortase-mediated coupling of ChpC has been demonstrated, and it is expected that ChpA and ChpB are also anchored to the cell wall [2].	u

PF03795	YCII	YCII-related domain	The majority of proteins in this family consist of a single copy of this domain, though it is also found as a repeat (Swiss:Q9AJZ7). A strongly conserved histidine and a aspartate suggest that the domain has an enzymatic function.  This family also now includes the family formerly known as the DGPF domain (COG3795). Although its function is unknown it is found fused to a sigma-70 factor family domain in Swiss:Q9A8M4.  Suggesting that this domain plays a role in transcription initiation (Bateman A per. obs.). This domain is named after the most conserved motif in the alignment.	u
PF03796	DnaB_C	DnaB-like helicase C terminal domain	The hexameric helicase DnaB unwinds the DNA duplex at the Escherichia coli chromosome replication fork. Although the mechanism by which DnaB both couples ATP hydrolysis to translocation along DNA and denatures the duplex is unknown, a change in the quaternary structure of the protein involving dimerisation of the N-terminal domain has been observed and may occur during the enzymatic cycle. This C-terminal domain contains an ATP-binding site and is therefore probably the site of ATP hydrolysis.	m

PF03937	Sdh5	Flavinator of succinate dehydrogenase	This family includes the highly conserved mitochondrial and bacterial proteins Sdh5/SDHAF2/SdhE. Both yeast and human Sdh5/SDHAF2 interact with the catalytic subunit of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex, a component of both the electron transport chain and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Sdh5 is required for SDH-dependent respiration and for Sdh1 flavination (incorporation of the flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor). Mutational inactivation of Sdh5 confers tumor susceptibility in humans [1]. Bacterial homologues of Sdh5, termed SdhE, are functionally conserved being required for the flavinylation of SdhA and succinate dehydrogenase activity. Like Sdh5, SdhE interacts with SdhA. Furthermore, SdhE was characterised as a FAD co-factor chaperone that directly binds FAD to facilitate the flavinylation of SdhA. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that SdhE/Sdh5 proteins evolved only once in an ancestral alpha-proteobacteria prior to the evolution of the mitochondria and now remain in subsequent descendants including eukaryotic mitochondria and the alpha, beta and gamma proteobacteria [2].  This family was previously annotated in Pfam as being a divergent TPR repeat but structural evidence has indicated this is not true. The E. coli protein, YgfY also acts as the antitoxin to the membrane-bound toxin family Cpta, Pfam:PF13166, whose E. coli member YgfX, expressed from the same operon as YgfY [3].	y

PF03969	AFG1_ATPase	AFG1-like ATPase	This P-loop motif-containing family of proteins includes AFG1, LACE1 and ZapE. ATPase family gene 1 (AFG1) is a 377 amino acid yeast protein with an ATPase motif typical of the family [1]. LACE1, the  mammalian homologue of AFG1, is a mitochondrial integral membrane protein that is essential for maintenance of fused mitochondrial reticulum and lamellar cristae morphology. It has also been demonstrated that LACE1 mediates degradation of nuclear-encoded complex IV subunits COX4 (cytochrome c oxidase 4), COX5A and COX6A, and is required for normal activity of complexes III and IV of the respiratory chain [2]. ZapE is a cell division protein found in Gram-negative bacteria. The bacterial cell division process relies on the assembly, positioning, and constriction of FtsZ ring (the so-called Z-ring), a ring-like network that marks  the future site of the septum of bacterial cell division. ZapE is a Z-ring associated protein required for cell division under low-oxygen conditions. It is an ATPase that appears at the constricting Z-ring late in cell division. It reduces the stability of FtsZ polymers in the presence of ATP in vitro [3]. 	m
PF03971	IDH	Monomeric isocitrate dehydrogenase	NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICD) is an important enzyme of the intermediary metabolism, as it controls the carbon flux within the citric acid cycle and supplies the cell with 2-oxoglutarate EC:1.1.1.42 and NADPH for biosynthetic purposes [2].	y
PF03976	PPK2	Polyphosphate kinase 2 (PPK2)	Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) plays a role in metabolism and regulation and has been proposed to serve as a energy source in a pre-ATP world.  In prokaryotes, the synthesis and utilisation of polyP are catalysed by PPK1, PPK2 and polyphosphatases.  Proteins with a single PPK2 domain catalyse polyP-dependent phosphorylation of ADP to ATP, whereas proteins containing 2 fused PPK2 domains phosphorylate AMP to ADP.                          The structure of PPK2 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa has revealed a a 3-layer alpha/beta/alpha sandwich fold with an alpha-helical lid similar to the structures of microbial thymidylate kinases [3].	y
PF03977	OAD_beta	Na+-transporting oxaloacetate decarboxylase beta subunit	Members of this family are integral membrane proteins.

PF04016	DUF364	Putative heavy-metal chelation	This domain of unknown function has a PLP-dependent transferase-like fold. Its genomic context suggests that it may have a role in anaerobic vitamin B12 biosynthesis. This domain is often found at the C-terminus of proteins containing DUF4213, Pfam:PF13938. The structure of UnioProtKB:B8FUJ5, PDB:3l5o, suggests that the protein has an enolase N-terminal-like fold and this Rossmann-like C-terminal domain.  Structural and bioinformatic analyses reveal partial similarities to Rossmann-like methyltransferases, with residues from the enolase-like fold combining to form a unique active site that is likely to be involved in the condensation or hydrolysis of molecules implicated in the synthesis of flavins, pterins or other siderophores. The protein may be playing a role in heavy-metal chelation [1].	u

PF04104	DNA_primase_lrg	Eukaryotic and archaeal DNA primase, large subunit	DNA primase is the polymerase that synthesises small RNA primers for the Okazaki fragments made during discontinuous DNA replication.  DNA primase is a heterodimer of two subunits, the small subunit Pri1 (48 kDa in yeast), and the large subunit Pri2 (58 kDa in the yeast S. cerevisiae) [1].  The large subunit of DNA primase forms interactions with the small subunit and the structure implicates that it is not directly involved in catalysis, but plays roles in correctly positioning the primase/DNA complex, and in the transfer of RNA to DNA polymerase [4].	m
PF04107	GCS2	Glutamate-cysteine ligase family 2(GCS2)	Also known as gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase and gamma-ECS (EC:6.3.2.2). This enzyme catalyses the first and rate limiting step in de novo glutathione biosynthesis. Members of this family are found in archaea, bacteria and plants. May and Leaver [1] discuss the possible evolutionary origins of glutamate-cysteine ligase enzymes in different organisms and suggest that it evolved independently in different eukaryotes, from an ancestral bacterial enzyme. They also state that Arabidopsis thaliana gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase is structurally unrelated to mammalian, yeast and Escherichia coli homologues.

PF04173	DoxD	TQO small subunit DoxD	Swiss:P97207 is a subunit of the terminal quinol oxidase present in the plasma  membrane of Acidianus ambivalens, with calculated molecular mass of 20.4 kDa [1]. Thiosulphate:quinone oxidoreductase (TQO) is one of the early steps in elemental sulphur oxidation.  A novel TQO enzyme was purified from the thermo-acidophilic archaeon Acidianus ambivalens and shown to consist of a large subunit (DoxD) and a smaller subunit (DoxA).

PF04197	Birna_RdRp	Birnavirus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (VP1)	Birnaviruses are dsRNA viruses. This family corresponds to the RNA dependent RNA polymerase. This protein is also known as VP1. All of the birnavirus VP1 proteins contain conserved RdRp motifs that reside in the catalytic "palm" domain of all classes of polymerases. However, the birnavirus RdRps lack the highly conserved Gly-Asp-Asp (GDD) sequence, a component of the proposed catalytic site of this enzyme family that exists in the conserved motif VI of the palm domain of other RdRps [1].	m
PF04199	Cyclase	Putative cyclase	Proteins in this family are thought to be cyclase enzymes.  They are found in proteins involved in antibiotic synthesis.  However they are also found in organisms that do not make antibiotics pointing to a wider role for these proteins. The proteins contain a conserved motif HXGTHXDXPXH that is likely to form part of the active site.	y

PF04209	HgmA	homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase	Homogentisate dioxygenase cleaves the aromatic ring during the  metabolic degradation of Phe and Tyr. Homogentisate dioxygenase deficiency causes alkaptonuria.  The structure of homogentisate dioxygenase shows that the enzyme forms a hexamer arrangement comprised of a dimer of trimers.

PF04226	Transgly_assoc	Transglycosylase associated protein	Bacterial protein, predicted to be an integral membrane protein. Some family members have been annotated as transglycosylase associated proteins, but no experimental evidence is provided.  This family was annotated based on the information in Swiss:P76011.	y
PF04227	Indigoidine_A	Indigoidine synthase A like protein	Indigoidine is a blue pigment synthesised by Erwinia chrysanthemi implicated in pathogenicity and protection from oxidative stress.

PF04230	PS_pyruv_trans	Polysaccharide pyruvyl transferase	Pyruvyl-transferases involved in peptidoglycan-associated polymer  biosynthesis.  CsaB in Bacillus anthracis is necessary for the non-covalent anchoring of proteins containing an SLH (S-layer homology) domain to peptidoglycan-associated pyruvylated polysaccharides.

PF04231	Endonuclease_1	Endonuclease I	Bacterial periplasmic or secreted endonuclease I (EC:3.1.21.1) E. coli endonuclease I (EndoI) is a sequence independent endonuclease located in the periplasm. It is inhibited by different RNA species.  It is thought to normally generate double strand breaks in DNA, except in the presence of high salt concentrations and RNA, when it generates single strand breaks in DNA. Its biological role is unknown [1].  Other family members are known to be extracellular [2].  This family also includes a non-specific, Mg2+ activated ribonuclease precursor (Swiss:Q03091) [3].	m

PF04262	Glu_cys_ligase	Glutamate-cysteine ligase 	Family of bacterial f glutamate-cysteine ligases (EC:6.3.2.2) that carry out the first step of the glutathione biosynthesis pathway.	y
PF04263	TPK_catalytic	Thiamin pyrophosphokinase, catalytic domain	Family of thiamin pyrophosphokinase (EC:2.7.6.2). Thiamin pyrophosphokinase (TPK) catalyses the transfer of a pyrophosphate group from ATP to vitamin B1 (thiamin) to form the coenzyme thiamin pyrophosphate (TPP). Thus, TPK is important for the formation of a coenzyme required for central metabolic functions. The structure of thiamin pyrophosphokinase suggest that the enzyme may operate by a mechanism of pyrophosphoryl transfer similar to those described for pyrophosphokinases functioning in nucleotide biosynthesis [1].	y
PF04264	YceI	YceI-like domain	E. coli YceI is a base-induced periplasmic protein [1]. The recent structure of a member of this family shows that it binds to poly-isoprenoid [2]. The structure consists of an extended, eight-stranded, antiparallel beta-barrel that resembles the lipocalin fold.	u
PF04267	SoxD	Sarcosine oxidase, delta subunit family 	Sarcosine oxidase is a hetero-tetrameric enzyme that contains both covalently bound FMN and non-covalently bound FAD and NAD(+).  This enzyme catalyses the oxidative demethylation of sarcosine to yield glycine, H2O2, and 5,10-CH2-tetrahydrofolate (H4folate) in a reaction requiring H4folate and O2 [1,2].	y
PF04268	SoxG	Sarcosine oxidase, gamma subunit family 	Sarcosine oxidase is a hetero-tetrameric enzyme that contains both covalently bound FMN and non-covalently bound FAD and NAD(+).

PF04275	P-mevalo_kinase	Phosphomevalonate kinase 	Phosphomevalonate kinase (EC:2.7.4.2) catalyses the  phosphorylation of 5-phosphomevalonate into 5-diphosphomevalonate,  an essential step in isoprenoid biosynthesis via the mevalonate  pathway [1]. This family represents the animal type of the  enzyme. The other is the ERG8 type, found in plants and fungi, and some bacteria (see Pfam:PF00288).	y

PF04286	DUF445	Protein of unknown function (DUF445)	Predicted to be a membrane protein.	u
PF04295	GD_AH_C	D-galactarate dehydratase / Altronate hydrolase, C terminus	Family members include the C termini of D-galactarate dehydratase  (EC:4.2.1.42) which is thought to catalyse the reaction  D-galactarate = 5-keto-4-deoxy-D-glucarate + H2O, [1] and altronate  hydrolase (altronic acid hydratase, EC:4.2.1.7), which catalyses D-altronate = 2-keto-2-deoxygluconate + H2O [2]. As purified, both enzymes are catalytically inactive in the absence of  added Fe2+, Mn2+, and beta-mercaptoethanol.  Synergistic activation of altronate hydrolase activity is seen in the presence of both iron and manganese ions, suggesting that the enzyme may have two ion binding sites. Mn2+ appears to be part of the enzyme active centre, but the function of  the single bound Fe2+ ion is unknown.  The hydratase has no Fe-S core [3].	y
PF04299	FMN_bind_2	Putative FMN-binding domain	In Bacillus subtilis, family member Swiss:P21341 (PAI 2/ORF-2) was found to be essential for growth [1]. The SUPERFAMILY database finds that this domain is related to FMN-binding domains, suggesting this protein is also FMN-binding.	u
PF04303	PrpF	PrpF protein	PrpF is a protein found in the 2-methylcitrate pathway. It is structurally similar to DAP epimerase and proline racemase. This protein is likely to acts to isomerise trans-aconitate to cis-aconitate [1].	y
PF04304	DUF454	Protein of unknown function (DUF454)	Predicted membrane protein.	u
PF04307	YdjM	LexA-binding, inner membrane-associated putative hydrolase	YdjM is a family of putative LexA-binding proteins.

Expression of YdjM is regulated by LexA [1].	u
PF04320	DUF469	Protein with unknown function (DUF469)	Family of bacteria protein with no known function.	u
PF04321	RmlD_sub_bind	RmlD substrate binding domain	L-rhamnose is a saccharide required for the virulence of some bacteria. Its precursor, dTDP-L-rhamnose, is synthesised by four different enzymes the final one of which is RmlD.                             The RmlD substrate binding domain is responsible for binding a sugar nucleotide [1,2].	y
PF04325	DUF465	Protein of unknown function (DUF465)	Family members are found in small bacterial proteins, and also in the heavy chains of eukaryotic myosin and kinesin, C terminal of the motor domain (Myosin Pfam:PF00063, Kinesin Pfam:PF00225). Members of this family may form coiled coil structures.	u
PF04332	DUF475	Protein of unknown function (DUF475)	Predicted to be an integral membrane protein with multiple membrane spans.	u
PF04339	FemAB_like	Peptidogalycan biosysnthesis/recognition	FemAB_like is a family of both baterial and Viridiplantae proteins with responsibility for building interpeptide bridges in peptidoglycan. Such a function is feasible for bacteria but less likely for the plant members of this family. Perhaps the plant-members are using homologous proteins to recognise bacterial peptidoglcans as part of their innate immune system [1].	s
PF04341	DUF485	Protein of unknown function, DUF485	This family includes several putative integral membrane proteins.	u
PF04343	DUF488	Protein of unknown function, DUF488	This family includes several proteins of uncharacterised function.	u

PF04346	EutH	Ethanolamine utilisation protein, EutH	EutH is a bacterial membrane protein whose molecular function is unknown. It has been suggested that it may act as an ethanolamine transporter, responsible for carrying ethanolamine from the periplasm to the cytoplasm [1].	y
PF04349	MdoG	Periplasmic glucan biosynthesis protein, MdoG	This family represents MdoG, a protein that is necessary for the synthesis of periplasmic glucans. The function of MdoG remains unknown. It has been suggested that it may catalyse the addition of branches to a linear glucan backbone.	s
PF04358	DsrC	DsrC like protein	Family member Swiss:P45573 has been observed to co-purify with  Desulfovibrio vulgaris dissimilatory sulfite reductase [1], and many  members of this family are annotated as the third (gamma) subunit of  dissimilatory sulphite reductase. However, this protein appears to be only loosely associated to the  sulfite reductase, which suggests that DsrC may not be an integral part of the dissimilatory sulphite reductase.  Members of this family are found in organisms such as E. coli and H. influenzae which do not contain  dissimilatory sulphite reductases but can synthesise assimilatory sirohaem  sulphite and nitrite reductases.  It is speculated that DsrC may be  involved in the assembly, folding or stabilisation of sirohaem proteins [2].  The strictly conserved cysteine in the C terminus suggests that DsrC may have a catalytic function in the metabolism of sulphur compounds [3].	y
PF04363	DUF496	Protein of unknown function (DUF496)		u
PF04365	BrnT_toxin	Ribonuclease toxin, BrnT, of type II toxin-antitoxin system	BrnT is a ribonuclease toxin of a type II toxin-antitoxin system that exhibits a RelE-like fold. The antitoxin that neutralises this toxin is Pfam:PF14384. BrnT is found in bacteria, archaea, bacteriophage, and plasmids. BrnT-BrnA forms a 2:2 tetrameric complex and autoregulates its own expression, which is induced by a number of different environmental stresses. Expression of BrnT alone results in cessation of bacterial growth which can be rescued after subsequent expression of BrnA [1].	m
PF04371	PAD_porph	Porphyromonas-type peptidyl-arginine deiminase	Peptidyl-arginine deiminase (PAD) enzymes catalyse the deimination of the guanidino group from carboxy-terminal arginine residues of various peptides to produce ammonia.  PAD from Porphyromonas gingivalis (PPAD) appears to be evolutionarily unrelated to mammalian PAD (Pfam:PF03068), which is a metalloenzyme.  PPAD is thought to belong to the same superfamily as aminotransferase and arginine deiminase, and to form an alpha/beta propeller structure. This family has previously been named PPADH (Porphyromonas peptidyl-arginine deiminase homologues) [1]. The predicted catalytic residues in PPAD (Swiss:Q9RQJ2) are Asp130, Asp187, His236, Asp238 and Cys351 [1]. These are absolutely conserved with the exception of Asp187 which is absent in two family members.  PPAD is also able to catalyse the deimination of free L-arginine, but has primarily peptidyl-arginine specificity.  It may have a FMN cofactor [2].	y
PF04376	ATE_N	Arginine-tRNA-protein transferase, N terminus	This family represents the N terminal region of the enzyme  arginine-tRNA-protein transferase (EC 2.3.2.8), which catalyses the post-translational conjugation of arginine to the N terminus of a protein. In eukaryotes, this functions as part of the N-end rule pathway  of protein degradation by conjugating a de-stabilising amino acid to the amino terminal aspartate or glutamate of a protein, targeting the protein for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis.  N terminal cysteine is sometimes  modified [1]. In S cerevisiae, Cys20, 23, 94 and/or 95 are thought to be important  for activity [2].  Of these, only Cys 94 appears to be completely conserved in this family.	y
PF04378	RsmJ	Ribosomal RNA large subunit methyltransferase D, RlmJ	RlmJ is ribosomal RNA large subunit methyltransferase J is required for full methylation of 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) during ribosome biogenesis. The ribosomal RNA of E. coli carries 24 residues that require methylation, and this methyltransferase is the last to be described, that modifies A2030 [1]. RlmJ displays a variant of the Rossmann-like methyltransferase (MTase) fold with an inserted helical subdomain. On binding cofactor and substrate a large shift of the N-terminal motif X tail is induced in order to make it cover the cofactor-binding site and to trigger active-site changes in motifs IV and VIII [2].	y
PF04387	PTPLA	Protein tyrosine phosphatase-like protein, PTPLA	This family includes the mammalian protein tyrosine phosphatase-like protein, PTPLA. A significant variation of PTPLA from other protein tyrosine phosphatases is the presence of proline instead of catalytic arginine at the active site. It is thought that PTPLA proteins have a role in the development, differentiation, and maintenance of a number of tissue types [1].	m
PF04389	Peptidase_M28	Peptidase family M28		m
PF04402	SIMPL	Protein of unknown function (DUF541)	Members of this family have so far been found in bacteria and mouse SwissProt or TrEMBL entries.  However possible family members have also been identified in translated rat (Genbank:AW144450) and human (Genbank:AI478629) ESTs. A mouse family member has been named SIMPL (signalling molecule that associates with mouse pelle-like kinase).  SIMPL appears to facilitate and/or regulate complex formation between IRAK/mPLK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) and IKK (inhibitor of kappa-B kinase) containing complexes, and thus regulate NF-kappa-B activity [1]. Separate experiments demonstrate that a mouse family member (named LaXp180) binds the Listeria monocytogenes surface protein ActA, which is a virulence factor that induces actin polymerisation. It may also bind stathmin, a protein involved in signal transduction and in the regulation of microtubule dynamics [2]. In bacteria its function is unknown, but it is thought to be located in the periplasm or outer membrane.	u
PF04406	TP6A_N	Type IIB DNA topoisomerase	Type II DNA topoisomerases are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyse the ATP-dependent transport of one DNA duplex through a second DNA segment via a transient double-strand break.  Type II DNA topoisomerases are now subdivided into two sub-families, type IIA and IIB DNA topoisomerases.  TP6A_N is present in type IIB topoisomerase and is thought to be involved in DNA binding owing to its sequence similarity to E. coli catabolite activator protein (CAP) [1]. 	m
PF04412	DUF521	Protein of unknown function (DUF521)	Family of hypothetical proteins.	u
PF04413	Glycos_transf_N	3-Deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic-acid transferase (kdotransferase)	Members of this family transfer activated sugars to a variety of substrates, including glycogen, fructose-6-phosphate and lipopolysaccharides.  Members of the family transfer UDP, ADP, GDP or CMP linked sugars.  The Glycos_transf_N region is flanked at the N-terminus by a signal peptide and at the C-terminus by Glycos_transf_1 (Pfam:PF00534).  The eukaryotic  glycogen synthases may be distant members of this bacterial  family [1].	s
PF04414	tRNA_deacylase	D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase	Several aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have the ability to transfer the D-isomer of their amino acid onto their cognate tRNA. D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylases hydrolyse the ester bond between the polynucleotide and the D-amino acid, thereby preventing the accumulation of such mis-acylated and metabolically inactive tRNA molecules.	y
PF04417	DUF501	Protein of unknown function (DUF501)	Family of uncharacterised bacterial proteins.	u
PF04419	4F5	4F5 protein family	Members of this family are short proteins that are rich in aspartate, glutamate, lysine and arginine. Although the function of these proteins is unknown, they are found to be ubiquitously expressed [1].	y
PF04422	FrhB_FdhB_N	Coenzyme F420 hydrogenase/dehydrogenase, beta subunit N-term	Coenzyme F420 hydrogenase (EC:1.12.99.1) reduces the low-potential two-electron acceptor coenzyme F420.  This family contains the N termini of F420 hydrogenase and dehydrogenase beta subunits [1], [2].  The N terminus of Methanobacterium formicicum formate dehydrogenase beta chain (EC:1.2.1.2, Swiss:P06130) is also a member of this family [3]. This region is often found in association with the 4Fe-4S binding domain, fer4 (Pfam:PF00037).	y
PF04428	Choline_kin_N	Choline kinase N terminus	Found N terminal to choline/ethanolamine kinase regions (Pfam:PF01633) in some plant and fungal choline kinase enzymes (EC:2.7.1.32).  This region is only found in some members of the choline kinase family, and is therefore unlikely to contribute to catalysis.	y
PF04439	Adenyl_transf	Streptomycin adenylyltransferase	Also known as Aminoglycoside 6- adenylyltransferase (EC:2.7.7.-), this protein confers resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics.	y
PF04443	LuxE	Acyl-protein synthetase, LuxE	LuxE is an acyl-protein synthetase found in bioluminescent bacteria.  LuxE catalyses the formation of an acyl-protein thioester from a fatty acid and a protein.                    This is the second step in the bioluminescent fatty acid reduction system, which converts tetradecanoic acid to the aldehyde substrate of the luciferase-catalysed bioluminescence reaction [1] A conserved cysteine found at position 364 in Photobacterium phosphoreum LuxE (Swiss:Q52100) is thought to be acylated during the transfer of the acyl group from the synthetase subunit to the reductase.  The carboxyl terminal of the synthetase is though to act as a flexible arm to transfer acyl groups between the sites of activation and reduction [2]. This family also includes Vibrio cholerae RBFN protein (Swiss:Q06961), which is involved in the biosynthesis of the O-antigen component 3-deoxy-L-glycero-tetronic acid.	y
PF04445	SAM_MT	Putative SAM-dependent methyltransferase	This is a family of putative SAM-dependent methyltransferases.	y
PF04446	Thg1	tRNAHis guanylyltransferase	The Thg1 protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is responsible for adding a GMP residue to the 5' end of tRNA His [1]. The catalytic domain Thg1 contains a RRM (ferredoxin) fold palm domain, just like the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases, family A and B DNA polymerases, adenylyl cyclases,  diguanylate cyclases (GGDEF domain) and the predicted polymerase of the CRISPR system [2]. Thg1 possesses an active site with three  acidic residues that chelate Mg++ cations [2]. Thg1 catalyzes  polymerization similar to the 5'-3' polymerases [2][3].	y
PF04452	Methyltrans_RNA	RNA methyltransferase	RNA methyltransferases modify nucleotides during ribosomal RNA maturation in a site-specific manner.  The Escherichia coli member is specific for U1498 methylation [1][2].	m
PF04471	Mrr_cat	Restriction endonuclease	Prokaryotic family found in type II restriction enzymes containing the hallmark (D/E)-(D/E)XK active site. Presence of catalytic residues implicates this region in the enzymatic cleavage of DNA [1,2].	m
PF04476	4HFCP_synth	4-HFC-P synthase	(5-formylfuran-3-yl)methyl phosphate synthase, also known as 4-HFC-P synthase, is involved in the production of methanofuran [1,2]. This family has a classical TIM-barrel structure whose biological unit is a homohexamer [1].	y
PF04479	RTA1	RTA1 like protein	This family is comprised of fungal proteins with multiple transmembrane regions.  RTA1 (Swiss:P53047) is involved in resistance to 7-aminocholesterol [1], while RTM1 (Swiss:P40113) confers resistance to an an unknown toxic chemical in molasses [2].  These proteins may bind to the toxic substance, and thus prevent toxicity.  They are not thought to be involved in the efflux of xenobiotics [1].	u
PF04480	DUF559	Protein of unknown function (DUF559)		u
PF04507	DUF576	Csa1 family	This family contains several uncharacterised staphylococcal proteins. These proteins have been called conserved staphylococcal antigens (Csa) [1]. 	u
PF04536	TPM_phosphatase	TPM domain	This family was first named TPM domain after its founding proteins: TLP18.3, Psb32 and MOLO-1. In Arabidopsis, this domain is called the thylakoid acid phosphatase -TAP - domain and has a Rossmann-like fold [1]. In plants, the family resides in the thylakoid lumen attached to the outer membrane of the chloroplast/plastid. It is active in the photosystem II [2,3].	y
PF04551	GcpE	GcpE protein	In a variety of organisms, including plants and several eubacteria, isoprenoids are synthesised by the mevalonate-independent 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. Although different enzymes of this pathway have been described, the terminal biosynthetic steps of the MEP pathway have not been fully elucidated. GcpE gene of Escherichia coli is involved in this pathway [2].	y
PF04555	XhoI	Restriction endonuclease XhoI	This family consists of type II restriction enzymes (EC:3.1.21.4) that recognise the double-stranded sequence CTCGAG and cleave after C-1.	m
PF04572	Gb3_synth	Alpha 1,4-glycosyltransferase conserved region	The glycosphingolipids (GSL) form part of eukaryotic cell membranes. They consist of a hydrophilic carbohydrate moiety linked to a hydrophobic ceramide tail embedded within the lipid bilayer of the membrane. Lactosylceramide, Gal1,4Glc1Cer (LacCer), is the common synthetic precursor to the majority of GSL found in vertebrates. Alpha 1.4-glycosyltransferases utilise UDP donors and transfer the sugar to a beta-linked acceptor. This region appears to be confined to higher eukaryotes. No function has been yet assigned to this region [1].  	y
PF04577	DUF563	Protein of unknown function (DUF563)	Family of uncharacterised proteins.	u
PF04587	ADP_PFK_GK	ADP-specific Phosphofructokinase/Glucokinase conserved region	In archaea a novel type of glycolytic pathway exists that is deviant from the classical Embden-Meyerhof pathway. This pathway utilises two novel proteins: an ADP-dependent Glucokinase and an ADP-dependent Phosphofructokinase.  This conserved region is present at the C-terminal of both these proteins.  Interestingly this family contains sequences from higher eukaryotes. [1,2,3]. 	y
PF04607	RelA_SpoT	Region found in RelA / SpoT proteins	This region of unknown function is found in RelA and SpoT of Escherichia coli, and their homologues in plants and in other eubacteria.

PF05191	ADK_lid	Adenylate kinase, active site lid	Comparisons of adenylate kinases have revealed  a particular divergence in the active site lid. In some organisms, particularly the Gram-positive bacteria, residues in the lid domain have been mutated to cysteines and these cysteine residues are responsible for the binding of a zinc ion. The bound zinc ion in the lid domain, is clearly  structurally homologous to Zinc-finger domains. However, it is unclear whether the adenylate kinase lid is a novel zinc-finger DNA/RNA binding domain, or that the lid bound zinc serves a purely  structural function [1].	y

PF05711	TylF	Macrocin-O-methyltransferase (TylF)	This family consists of bacterial macrocin O-methyltransferase (TylF) proteins. TylF is responsible for the methylation of macrocin to produce tylosin. Tylosin is a macrolide antibiotic used in veterinary medicine to treat infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria and as an animal growth promoter in the swine industry. It is produced by several Streptomyces species. As with other macrolides, the antibiotic activity of tylosin is due to the inhibition of protein biosynthesis by a mechanism that involves the binding of tylosin to the ribosome, preventing the formation of the mRNA-aminoacyl-tRNA-ribosome complex [1]. The structure of one representative sequence from this family, NovP, shows it to be an S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase that catalyses the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin antibiotic novobiocin. Specifically, it methylates at 4-OH of the noviose moiety, and the resultant methoxy group is important for the potency of the mature antibiotic. It is likely that the key structural features of NovP are common to the rest of the family and include: a helical 'lid' region that gates access to the co-substrate binding pocket and an active centre that contains a 3-Asp putative metal binding site. A further conserved Asp probably acts as the general base that initiates the reaction by de-protonating the 4-OH group of the noviose unit [2].	y

PF05881	CNPase	2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP or CNPase)	This family consists of the eukaryotic protein 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP). 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP) is one of the earliest myelin-related proteins expressed in differentiating oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. CNP is abundant in the central nervous system and in oligodendrocytes. This protein is also found in mammalian photoreceptor cells, testis and lymphocytes. Although the biological function of CNP is unknown, it is thought to play a significant role in the formation of the myelin sheath, where it comprises 4% of total protein. CNP selectively cleaves 2',3'-cyclic nucleotides to produce 2'-nucleotides in vitro. Although physiologically relevant substrates with 2',3'-cyclic termini are still unknown, numerous cyclic phosphate containing RNAs occur transiently within eukaryotic cells. Other known protein families capable of hydrolysing 2',3'-cyclic nucleotides include tRNA ligases and plant cyclic phosphodiesterases. The catalytic domains from all these proteins contain two tetra-peptide motifs H-X-T/S-X, where X is usually a hydrophobic residue. Mutation of either histidine in CNP abolishes enzymatic activity [1]. CNPases belong to the 2H phosphoesterase superfamily.

Sec is the only amino acid whose biosynthesis occurs on its cognate transfer RNA (tRNA). SepSecS catalyses the final step in the formation of the amino acid [3,4,5,6].  The early observation that autoantibodies isolated from patients with type I autoimmune hepatitis targeted a ribonucleoprotein complex containing tRNASec led to the identification and characterisation of the archaeal and the human SepSecS [2]. SepSecS forms its own branch in the family of fold-type I pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) enzymes that goes back to the last universal common ancestor which explains why the archaeal sequences Swiss:Q8TXK0 and Swiss:Q8TYR3 are annotated as being pyridoxal phosphate-dependent enzymes.	y
PF05891	Methyltransf_PK	AdoMet dependent proline di-methyltransferase	This protein is expressed in the tail neuron PVT and in uterine cells in C. elegans [worm-base]. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae this is AdoMet dependent proline di-methyltransferase. This enzyme catalyses the di-methylation of ribosomal proteins Rpl12 and Rps25 at N-terminal proline residues. The methyltransferases described here specifically recognise the N-terminal X-Pro-Lys sequence motif, and they may account for nearly all previously described eukaryotic protein N-terminal methylation reactions. A number of other yeast and human proteins also share the recognition motif and may be similarly modified [1]. As with other methyltransferases, this family carries the characteristic GxGxG motif.	y
PF05893	LuxC	Acyl-CoA reductase (LuxC)	This family consists of several bacterial Acyl-CoA reductase (LuxC) proteins. The channelling of fatty acids into the fatty aldehyde substrate for the bacterial bioluminescence reaction is catalysed by a fatty acid reductase multienzyme complex, which channels fatty acids through the thioesterase (LuxD), synthetase (LuxE) and reductase (LuxC) components [1].	y

PF05925	IpgD	Enterobacterial virulence protein IpgD	This family consists of several enterobacterial IpgD like virulence factor proteins. In the Gram-negative pathogen Shigella flexneri, the virulence factor IpgD is translocated directly into eukaryotic cells and acts as a potent inositol 4-phosphatase that specifically dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P(2)] into phosphatidylinositol 5-monophosphate [PtdIns(5)P] that then accumulates. Transformation of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) into PtdIns(5)P by IpgD is responsible for dramatic morphological changes of the host cell, leading to a decrease in membrane tether force associated with membrane blebbing and actin filament remodelling [1].	y
PF05935	Arylsulfotrans	Arylsulfotransferase (ASST)	This family consists of several bacterial Arylsulfotransferase proteins. Arylsulfotransferase (ASST) transfers a sulfate group from phenolic sulfate esters to a phenolic acceptor substrate [1]. 	y

A 5-methyluridine (m(5)U) residue at position 54 is a conserved feature of bacterial and eukaryotic tRNAs. The methylation of U54 is catalysed by the tRNA(m5U54)methyltransferase, which in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is encoded by the nonessential TRM2 gene. It is thought that tRNA modification enzymes might have a role in tRNA maturation not necessarily linked to their known catalytic activity [1].	y

METTL16 is a conserved RNA methyltransferase which interacts specifically with the MALAT1 triple helix. METTL16 shows nuclear localisation [1]. Another functional study indicates that METTL16 regulates expression of human MAT2A, which encodes the SAM synthetase expressed in most cells. Furthermore, results indicate that METTL16 is the long-unknown methyltransferase for the U6 spliceosomal small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and it has evolved an additional function in vertebrates to control SAM homeostasis by post-transcriptionally regulating SAM synthetase gene expression [2].	u

Phytobilins are linear tetrapyrrole precursors of the light-harvesting prosthetic groups of the phytochrome photoreceptors of plants and the phycobiliprotein photosynthetic antennae of cyanobacteria, red algae, and cryptomonads. It is known that that phytobilins are synthesised from heme via the intermediary of biliverdin IX alpha (BV), which is reduced subsequently by ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductases with different double-bond specificities [1]. 	y

Structural analysis of the surface features of the protein YvyC has revealed a single cluster of highly conserved residues on the surface. Additionally, these residues fall into two groups which lie within the two largest of the three cavities identified over the surface. The conclusion from this is that these two cavities with, Leu 58, Glu 75, Ile 82, and Glu 83 and Pro 86, conserved, are likely to be important for the molecular function and reflect the cavities found on the surface of the FlaG proteins in Pfam:PF03646.	u

PF06039	Mqo	Malate:quinone oxidoreductase (Mqo)	This family consists of several bacterial Malate:quinone oxidoreductase (Mqo) proteins (EC:1.1.99.16). Mqo takes part in the citric acid cycle. It oxidises L-malate to oxaloacetate and donates electrons to ubiquinone-1 and other artificial acceptors or, via the electron transfer chain, to oxygen. NAD is not an acceptor and the natural direct acceptor for the enzyme is most likely a quinone. The enzyme is therefore called malate:quinone oxidoreductase, abbreviated to Mqo. Mqo is a peripheral membrane protein and can be released from the membrane by addition of chelators [1].  	y
PF06050	HGD-D	2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase, D-component 	Degradation of glutamate via the hydroxyglutarate pathway involves the syn-elimination of water from 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA.

PF06082	YjbH	Exopolysaccharide biosynthesis protein YbjH	YjbH is a family of Gram-negative beta-barrel outer-membrane lipoproteins that act as putative porins. YbjH is one of four gene-products expressed from an operon, yjbEFGH, which is regulated by the Rcs phosphorelay in a RcsA-dependent manner, similar to that of other exopolysaccharide biosynthetic pathways. It is highly possible that the yjbEFGH operon encodes a system involved in EPS secretion since none of the products is predicted to have enzymic activity, the products are all secreted and YbjH and F are predicted to be beta-barrel lipoproteins similar to porins. It may be that the operon products play some role in biofilm formation and/or matrix production [1].	s
PF06087	Tyr-DNA_phospho	Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase	Covalent intermediates between topoisomerase I and DNA  can become dead-end complexes that lead to cell death. Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase can hydrolyse the bond between  topoisomerase I and DNA [1].	y

L-asparaginase (EC:3.5.1.1) catalyses the hydrolysis of L-asparagine to L-aspartate and ammonium. Rhizobium etli possesses two asparaginases: asparaginase I, which is thermostable and constitutive, and asparaginase II, which is thermolabile, induced by asparagine and repressed by the carbon source [1].	y
PF06090	Ins_P5_2-kin	Inositol-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase	This is a family of inositol-pentakisphosphate 2-kinases (EC 2.7.1.158) (also known as inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase, Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 2-kinase) and InsP5 2-kinase).       This enzyme phosphorylates Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 to form Ins(1,2,3,4,5,6)P6 (also known as InsP6 or phytate). InsP6 is involved in many processes such as mRNA export, nonhomologous end-joining, endocytosis and ion channel regulation.	y

PF06100	MCRA	MCRA family	The MCRA (myosin-cross-reactive antigen) family of proteins were thought to have structural features in common with the beta chain of the class II antigens, as well as myosin, and may play an important role in the pathogenesis[1]. More recent work shows that these proteins act as hydratase enzymes that convert linoleic acid and oleic acid to their respective 10-hydroxy derivatives.  It has been suggested that MCRA proteins catalyse the first step in conjugated linoleic acid production [2]. Proteins in this family act in an FAD dependent manner [3]. The structure of a fatty acid double-bond hydratase from Lactobacillus acidophilus has been recently solved showing four structural domains.	y
PF06114	Peptidase_M78	IrrE N-terminal-like domain	This entry includes the catalytic domain of the protein ImmA,  which is a metallopeptidase containing an HEXXH zinc-binding motif  from peptidase family M78. ImmA is encoded on a conjugative  transposon. Conjugating bacteria are able to transfer conjugative  transposons that can, for example, confer resistance to  antibiotics. The transposon is integrated into the chromosome, but  during conjugation excises itself and then moves to the recipient  bacterium and re-integrate into its chromosome. Typically a  conjugative tranposon encodes only the proteins required for this  activity and the proteins that regulate it. During exponential  growth, the ICEBs1 transposon of Bacillus subtilis is inactivated  by the immunity repressor protein ImmR, which is encoded by the  transposon and represses the genes for excision and transfer.  Cleavage of ImmR relaxes repression and allows transfer of the  transposon. ImmA has been shown to be essential for the cleavage  of ImmR [2]. This domain is also found in in metalloprotease IrrE, a central  regulator of DNA damage repair in Deinococcaceae [1], HTH-type  transcriptional regulators RamB [3] and PrpC [4].	y

PF06167	Peptidase_M90	Glucose-regulated metallo-peptidase M90	MtfA (earlier known as YeeI) is a transcription factor A that binds Mlc (make large colonies), itself a repressor of glucose and hence a protein important in regulation of the phosphoenolpyruvate:glucose-phosphotransferase (ptsG) system, the major glucose transporter in E.coli. Mlc is a repressor of ptsG, and MtfA is found to bind and inactivate Mlc with high affinity [1]. The membrane-bound protein EIICBGlc encoded by the ptsG gene is the major glucose transporter in Escherichia coli. MtfA is found to be a glucose-regulated peptidase [3], whose activity is regulated by binding to Mlc available in the cytoplasm, which in turn has been released from EIICBGlc during times when no glucose is taken up. A physiologically relevant target for this peptidase is not yet known.	m

Salmonella typhimurium 2-methylthio-cis-ribozeatin (ms2io6A) is found in tRNA, probably in the corresponding species that have ms2i6A in E. coli.  The miaE gene is absent in E. coli, a finding consistent with the absence of the hydroxylated derivative of ms2i6A in this species [1].	y

EHs have been found in all types of living organisms, including mammals, invertebrates, plants, fungi and bacteria. In animals, the major interest in EH is directed towards their detoxification capacity for epoxides since they are important safeguards against the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of oxirane derivatives that are often reactive electrophiles because of the high tension of the three-membered ring system and the strong polarization of the C--O bonds. This is of significant relevance because epoxides are frequent intermediary metabolites which arise during the biotransformation of foreign compounds [1].

When bound to nsp10, nsp16 is active as a type-0 RNA cap-dependent 2'-O-MTase, ie., active only when the cap guanine is methylated at its N7 position. Nsp10 binds to nsp16 through an activation surface area in nsp10, and the resulting complex exhibits RNA cap (nucleoside-2'-O)-methyltransferase activity.

This single domain protein is arranged to form an overall fold that consists of a four-layered alpha-beta-beta-alpha core structure. The two antiparallel beta-sheets pack against each other and are covered by alpha-helices on one face of the molecule.

The structure is predominantly a PLP-binding TIM barrel domain, with several additional alpha-helices and beta-strands at the N and C termini. These helices and strands form an intertwined accessory clamp structure that wraps around the sides of the TIM barrel and extends up toward the Ado ligand of the Cbl co-factor, providing most of the interactions observed between the protein and the Ado ligand of the Cbl, suggesting that its role is mainly in stabilising AdoCbl in the precatalytic resting state [1]. This is a TIM-barrel domain.	y

The electron-pair is then subsequently passed to an as yet unknown receiver [1]. The enzyme is found in a variety of different bacteria.	y
PF09472	MtrF	Tetrahydromethanopterin S-methyltransferase, F subunit (MtrF)	Many archaea have evolved energy-yielding pathways marked by one-carbon biochemistry featuring novel cofactors and enzymes. This domain is mostly found in MtrF, where it covers the entire length of the protein. This polypeptide is one of eight subunits of the N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin: coenzyme M methyltransferase complex found in methanogenic archaea. This is a membrane-associated enzyme complex that uses methyl-transfer reactions to drive a sodium-ion pump. MtrF itself is involved in the transfer of the methyl group from N5-methyltetrahydromethanopterin to coenzyme M. Subsequently, methane is produced by two-electron reduction of the methyl moiety in methyl-coenzyme M by another enzyme, methyl-coenzyme M reductase. In some organisms this domain is found at the C terminal region of what appears to be a fusion of the MtrA and MtrF proteins.

It is found in three nearly identical copies in each of Methanosarcina acetivorans, Methanosarcina barkeri, and Methanosarcina mazei. It is one of a suite of three non-homologous enzymes with a critical UAG-encoded pyrrolysine residue in these species (along with trimethylamine methyltransferase and monomethylamine methyltransferase). It demethylates dimethylamine, leaving monomethylamine, and methylates the prosthetic group of the small corrinoid protein MtbC. The methyl group is then transferred by methylcorrinoid:coenzyme M methyltransferase to coenzyme M. Note that the pyrrolysine residue is variously translated as K or X, or as a stop codon that truncates the sequence.	y
PF09506	Salt_tol_Pase	Glucosylglycerol-phosphate phosphatase (Salt_tol_Pase)	Proteins in this family are glucosylglycerol-phosphate phosphatases, with the gene symbol stpA (Salt Tolerance Protein A). A motif characteristic of acid phosphatases is found, but otherwise this family shows little sequence similarity to other phosphatases. This enzyme acts on the glucosylglycerol phosphate, product of glucosylglycerol phosphate synthase and immediate precursor of the osmoprotectant glucosylglycerol.	y
PF09508	Lact_bio_phlase	Lacto-N-biose phosphorylase N-terminal TIM barrel domain	The gene which codes for this protein in gut-bacteria is located in a novel putative operon for galactose metabolism. The protein appears to be a carbohydrate-processing phosphorolytic enzyme (EC:2.4.1.211), unlike either glycoside hydrolases or glycoside lyase. Intestinal colonisation by bifidobacteria is important for human health, especially in pediatrics, because colonisation seems to prevent infection by some pathogenic bacteria that cause diarrhoea or other illnesses. The operon seems to be involved in intestinal colonisation by bifidobacteria mediated by metabolism of mucin sugars. In addition, it may also resolve the question of the nature of the bifidus factor in human milk as the lacto-N-biose structure found in milk oligosaccharides.	s

The protein forms an oligomer and functions as a processive alkaline exonuclease that digests linear double-stranded DNA in a Mg(2+)-dependent reaction, It has a preference for 5'-phosphorylated DNA ends. It thus forms part of the two-component SynExo viral recombinase functional unit [1].	u
PF09594	GT87	Glycosyltransferase family 87	The enzymes in this family are glycosyltransferases. PimE is involved in phosphatidylinositol mannoside (PIM) synthesis, a major class of glycolipids in all mycobacteria. PimE is a polyprenol-phosphate-mannose-dependent mannosyltransferase that transfers the fifth mannose of PIM [1]. The family also includes alpha(1-->3) arabinofuranosyltransferase, invloved in the synthesis of of mycobacterial arabinogalactan [2].	s
PF09631	Sen15	Sen15 protein	The Sen15 subunit of the tRNA intron-splicing endonuclease is one of the two structural subunits of this hetero-tetrameric enzyme. Residues 36-157 of this subunit possess a novel homodimeric fold.  Each monomer consists of three alpha-helices and a mixed antiparallel/parallel beta-sheet. Two monomers of Sen15 fold with two monomers of Sen34, one of the two catalytic subunits, to form an alpha2-beta2 tetramer as part of the functional endonuclease assembly.	m
PF09663	Amido_AtzD_TrzD	Amidohydrolase ring-opening protein (Amido_AtzD_TrzD)	Members of this family are ring-opening amidohydrolases, including cyanuric acid amidohydrolase (CAH) (EC:3.5.2.15) (AtzD and TrzD) and barbituric acid hydrolase (BAH). Note that barbiturase does not act as defined for EC:3.5.2.1 (barbiturate + water = malonate + urea) but rather catalyses the ring opening of barbiturase acid to ureidomalonic acid. Cyanuric acid hydrolases (AtzD) and barbiturases are homologous and found almost exclusively in bacteria [1]. CAH is a homotetramer, the monomer of which possesses a fold that is dubbed the Toblerone fold. Although not obvious from the protein sequence, each CAH monomer possesses 3-fold rotational symmetry, for which the repeated structural motif is structurally similar to that of the YjgF superfamily of proteins (two alpha helices and a four-strand antiparallel beta-sheet), despite having low sequence similarity. This suggests that the Toblerone fold evolved from concatenated YjgF family proteins. The 3-fold symmetry of each CAH monomer extends to the active site, which contains three Arg-Lys-Ser triads, which bind the substrate via an extensive hydrogen bonding network [2].	y
PF09665	RE_Alw26IDE	Type II restriction endonuclease (RE_Alw26IDE)	Members of this entry are type II restriction endonucleases of the Alw26I/Eco31I/Esp3I family. Characterised specificities of the three members are GGTCTC, CGTCTC and the shared subsequence GTCTC.	m

The structure of a member from Bacteroides has been crystallised and modelled onto the luminal region of the human member of the family, the transmembrane glycoprotein N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphodiester alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase. There is some conservation of potentially functional residues, implying that in the bacterial members this family acts in some way as a phosphodiester glycosidase [1]. The human protein is also present, so the eukaryotic members are likely to be catalysing the second step in the formation of the mannose 6-phosphate targeting signal on lysosomal enzyme oligosaccharides [2].	y

It is encoded as part of an operon that also includes an histidine racemase and an enzyme distantly related to nicotianamine synthase [1]. Staphylopine is involved in metal acquisition, chelating nickel, cobalt, zinc, copper or iron, depending on the growing conditions. Metal acquisition is vital for bacteria growing in metal-scarce environments, such as inside a host in the case of pathogens.	y

PF10198	Ada3	Histone acetyltransferases subunit 3	Ada3 is a family of proteins conserved from yeasts to humans [1]. It is an essential component of the Ada transcriptional coactivator (alteration/deficiency in activation) complex. Ada3 plays a key role in linking histone acetyltransferase-containing complexes to p53 (tumour suppressor protein) thereby regulating p53 acetylation, stability and transcriptional activation following DNA damage [2].	m
PF10215	Ost4	Oligosaccaryltransferase  	Ost4 is a very short, approximately 30 residues, enzyme found from fungi to vertebrates. It is a member of the ER oligosaccaryltansferase complex, EC 2.4.1.119, that catalyses the asparagine-linked glycosylation of proteins. It appears to be an integral membrane protein that mediates the en bloc transfer of a preassembled high-mannose oligosaccharide onto asparagine residues of nascent polypeptides as they enter the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER).	s
PF10250	O-FucT	GDP-fucose protein O-fucosyltransferase	This is a family of conserved proteins representing the enzyme responsible for adding O-fucose to EGF (epidermal growth factor-like) repeats. Six highly conserved cysteines are present in O-FucT-1 as well as a DXD-like motif (ERD), conserved in mammals, Drosophila, and C. elegans. Both features are characteristic of several glycosyltransferase families. The enzyme is a membrane-bound protein released by proteolysis and, as for most glycosyltransferases, is strongly activated by manganese [1].	s
PF10282	Lactonase	Lactonase, 7-bladed beta-propeller	This entry contains bacterial 6-phosphogluconolactonases (6PGL)YbhE-type (EC:3.1.1.31) which hydrolyse 6-phosphogluconolactone to 6-phosphogluconate. The entry also contains the fungal muconate lactonising enzyme carboxy-cis,cis-muconate cyclase (EC:5.5.1.5) and muconate cycloisomerase (EC:5.5.1.1), which convert cis,cis-muconates to muconolactones and vice versa as part of the microbial beta-ketoadipate pathway.                          Structures of proteins in this family have revealed a 7-bladed beta-propeller fold [1].	y
PF10285	Luciferase_cat	Luciferase catalytic domain	This domain is the catalytic domain of dinoflagellate luciferase . Luciferase is involved in catalysing the light emitting reaction in bioluminescence. The structure of this domain has been solved [1].

PF10288	CTU2	Cytoplasmic tRNA 2-thiolation protein 2	CTU2 is a family of proteins necessary for the formation of the wobble nucleoside 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The family is conserved from plants to humans ]1]. It plays a central role in the 2-thiolation of 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine, or the wobble nucleoside [2]. This wobble modification in tRNAs, 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine (mcm(5)s(2)U), is required for the proper decoding of NNR codons in eukaryotes. The 2-thio group gives rigidity by largely fixing the C3'-endo ribose puckering, ensuring stable and accurate codon-anticodon pairing [3].	y
PF10294	Methyltransf_16	Lysine methyltransferase	Methyltrans_16 is a lysine methyltransferase. Characterised members of this family are protein methyltransferases targetting Lys residues in specific proteins, including calmodulin, VCP, Kin17 and Hsp70 proteins [2,3,4,5].	y
PF10343	Q_salvage	Potential Queuosine, Q, salvage protein family	Q_salvage proteins occur in most Eukarya as well as in a few bacteria possible via horizontal gene-transfer. Queuosine (Q) is a chemical modification found at the wobble position of tRNAs that have GUN anticodons. Most bacteria synthesize queuosine de novo, whereas eukaryotes rely solely on salvaging this essential component from the environment or the gut flora. The exact enzymatic function of the domain has yet to be determined, but structural similarity with DNA glycosidases suggests a ribonucleoside hydrolase role [1].	y
PF10354	DUF2431	Domain of unknown function (DUF2431)	This is the N-terminal domain of a family of proteins found from plants to humans. The function is not known.	u

PF10369	ALS_ss_C	Small subunit of acetolactate synthase	ALS_ss_C is the C-terminal half of a family of proteins which are the small subunits of acetolactate synthase.  Acetolactate synthase is a tetrameric enzyme, containing probably two large and two small subunits, which catalyses the first step in branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis. This reaction is sensitive to certain herbicides [1].	y
PF10394	Hat1_N	Histone acetyl transferase HAT1 N-terminus	This domain is the N-terminal half of the structure of histone acetyl transferase HAT1. It is often found in association with the C-terminal part of the GNAT Acetyltransf_1 (Pfam:PF00583) domain. It seems to be motifs C and D of the structure. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) catalyse the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the lysine E-amino groups on the N-terminal tails of histones. HATs are involved in transcription since histones tend to be hyper-acetylated in actively transcribed regions of chromatin, whereas in transcriptionally silent regions histones are hypo-acetylated [1].	m
PF10418	DHODB_Fe-S_bind	Iron-sulfur cluster binding domain of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase B	Lactococcus lactis is one of the few organisms with two dihydroorotate dehydrogenases, DHODs, A and B [1]. The B enzyme is a prototype for DHODs in Gram-positive bacteria that use NAD+ as the second substrate. DHODB is a hetero-tetramer composed of a central homodimer of PyrDB subunits resembling the DHODA structure and two PyrK subunits along with three different cofactors: FMN, FAD, and a [2Fe-2S] cluster. The [2Fe-2S] iron-sulfur cluster binds to this C-terminal domain of the PyrK subunit, which is at the interface between the flavin and NAD binding domains and contains three beta-strands. The four cysteine residues at the N-terminal part of this domain are the ones that bind, in pairs, to the iron-sulfur cluster. The conformation of the whole molecule means that the iron-sulfur cluster is localised in a well-ordered part of this domain close to the FAD binding site [2]. The FAD and and NAD binding domains are FAD_binding_6, Pfam:PF00970 and NAD_binding_1, Pfam:PF00175.	y
PF10432	bact-PGI_C	Bacterial phospho-glucose isomerase C-terminal SIS domain	This is the C-terminal SIS domain of a bacterial phospho-glucose isomerase EC:5.3.1.9 protein which is similar to eukaryote homologues to the extent that the sequence includes the cluster of threonines and serines that forms the sugar phosphate-binding site in conventional PGI. This domain contributes a good proportion of the active catalytic site residues. This PGI uses the same catalytic mechanisms for both glucose ring-opening and isomerisation for the interconversion of glucose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate [1].  It is associated with family SIS, Pfam:PF01380.	y
PF10459	Peptidase_S46	Peptidase S46	Dipeptidyl-peptidase 7 (DPP-7) is the best characterised member of this family.  It is a serine peptidase that is located on the cell surface and is predicted to have two N-terminal transmembrane domains.	m
PF10471	ANAPC_CDC26	Anaphase-promoting complex APC subunit CDC26	The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) or cyclosome is a cell cycle-regulated ubiquitin-protein ligase that regulates important events in mitosis such as the initiation of anaphase and exit from telophase. The APC, in conjunction with other enzymes, assembles multi-ubiquitin chains on a variety of regulatory proteins thereby targeting them for proteolysis by the 26S proteasome. CDC26 is one of the nine or so subunits identified within APC but its exact function is not known [1]. The APC/C becomes active at the metaphase/anaphase transition and remains active during G1 phase. One mechanism linked to activation of the APC/C is phosphorylation.  The yeast APC/C is composed of at least 13 subunits, but the function of many of the subunits is unknown. Hcn1 is the smallest subunit of the S. pombe APC/C, and is found to be essential for cell viability, APC/C integrity, and proper APC/C regulation. In addition, Hcn1 phosphorylation indicates a specific role for the phosphorylation of this subunit late in the cell cycle [2].	m
PF10503	Esterase_phd	Esterase PHB depolymerase	This family of proteins include acetyl xylan esterases (AXE), feruloyl esterases (FAE), and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) depolymerases.	y
PF10510	PIG-S	Phosphatidylinositol-glycan biosynthesis class S protein	PIG-S is one of several key, core, components of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) trans-amidase complex that mediates GPI anchoring in the endoplasmic reticulum. Anchoring occurs when a protein's C-terminal GPI attachment signal peptide is replaced with a pre-assembled GPI [1]. Mammalian GPITransamidase consists of at least five components: Gaa1, Gpi8, PIG-S, PIG-T, and PIG-U, all five of which are required for function. It is possible that Gaa1, Gpi8, PIG-S, and PIG-T form a tightly associated core that is only weakly associated with PIG-U.  The exact function of PIG-S is unclear [2].	y
PF10551	MULE	MULE transposase domain	This domain was identified by Babu and colleagues [1].	m
PF10563	CA_like	Putative carbonic anhydrase	This is a family of unknown function.

PF10566	Glyco_hydro_97	Glycoside hydrolase 97  	This domain is the catalytic region of the bacterial glycosyl-hydrolase family 97. This central part of the GH97 family protein sequences represents a typical and complete (beta/alpha)8-barrel or catalytic TIM-barrel type domain. The N- and C-terminal parts of the sequences, mainly consisting of beta-strands, form two additional non-catalytic domains [1].  In all known glycosidases with the (beta-alpha)8-barrel fold, the amino acid residues at the active site are located on the C-termini of the beta-strands [2,3].	s

PF10862	FcoT	FcoT-like thioesterase domain	Proteins in this family have a HotDog fold. This family was formerly known as domain of unknown function 2662 (DUF2662). The structure of Rv0098 from M. tuberculosis [1] suggested a thioesterase function. Assays showed that this protein was a thioesterase with a preference for long chain fatty acyl groups [1]. The maximal Kcat was observed for palmitoyl-CoA although longer and shorter molecules were also cleaved. In solution this protein forms a homo-hexameric complex.	y

PF12774	AAA_6	Hydrolytic ATP binding site of dynein motor region	This domain is found in human cytoplasmic dynein-2 proteins. Cytoplasmic dynein-2 (dynein-2) performs intraflagellar transport and is associated with human skeletal ciliopathies. Dyneins share a conserved motor domain that couples cycles of ATP hydrolysis with conformational changes to produce movement. Structural analysis reveal that the motor's ring consists of six AAA+ domains (ATPases associated with various cellular activities: AAA1-AAA6) [1]. This is the first site (out of four nucleotide binding sites in the dynein motor) where the movement depends on ATP hydrolysis [2]. When this site is nucleotide free or bound to ADP, the microtubule binding domain (MTBD) binds to the microtubule and the linker adopts the straight post-power-stroke conformation. Upon ATP binding and hydrolysis, the MTBD detaches from the microtubule and the linker is primed into the pre-power-stroke conformation. Dynein's AAA+ domains are each divided into an alpha/beta large subdomain designated with an L and and alpha small subdomains designated with an S. This is the AAA1 large (AAA1L) subdomain with the accompanying small subdomain (AAA1S). AAA1L, AAA1S and AAA2L enclose ADP.vanadate (ADP.Vi, ATP-hydrolysis transition state analogue). The AAA1L sensor-I loop, which varies in position depending on dynein's nucleotide state, swings in to contact AAA2L forming the important AAA1 nucleotide-binding site [1].	m

Members of this  family catalyze nucleic acid modifications, such as thymidine hydroxylation during base J synthesis in kinetoplastids [2], and the conversion of 5 methyl-cytosine (5-mC) to 5-hydroxymethyl-cytosine  (hmC) [3], or further oxidation to 5-formylcytosine (5fC) and  5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) [4]. Metazoan TET proteins contain a  cysteine-rich region inserted into the core of the DSBH fold.  Vertebrate TET proteins are oncogenes that are mutated in various  myeloid cancers [5].

The APC is made up of four parts, the third of which is a tetratricopeptide repeat arm (TPR) that contains Apc9 [3].	m
PF12859	ANAPC1	Anaphase-promoting complex subunit 1	Apc1 is the largest of the subunits of the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome. The anaphase-promoting complex is a multiprotein subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that controls segregation of chromosomes and exit from mitosis in eukaryotes [1,2]. Infection of human fibroblasts with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) leads to cell cycle dysregulation, which is associated with the inactivation of the anaphase-promoting complex [3].	m
PF12862	ANAPC5	Anaphase-promoting complex subunit 5	Apc5 is a subunit of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) which is a multi-subunit ubiquitin ligase that mediates the proteolysis of cell cycle proteins in mitosis and G1.  Apc5, although it does not harbour a classical RNA binding domain, Apc5 binds the poly(A) binding protein (PABP), which directly binds the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of growth factor 2 mRNA. PABP was found to enhance IRES-mediated translation, whereas Apc5 over-expression counteracted this effect. In addition to its association with the APC/C complex, Apc5 binds much heavier complexes and co-sediments with the ribosomal fraction [1,2]. The N-terminus of Afi1 serves to stabilise the union between Apc4 and Apc5, both of which lie towards the bottom-front of the APC [3]. This region of the Apc5 member proteins carries a TPR-like motif.	m

Alternatively it can be referred to as butirosin biosynthesis protein H. BtrH transfers the unique (S)-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyrate (AHBA) side chain, which protects the antibiotic butirosin from several common resistance mechanisms. Butirosin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic produced by Bacillus circulans, exhibits improved antibiotic properties over its parent molecule and retains bactericidal activity toward many aminoglycoside-resistant strains.

Prokaryotic JAB domains are predicted to  have a similar role in their cognates of the  ubiquitin modification pathway [2,3]. The domain is widely found in bacteria,  archaea and phages where they are present in several gene contexts  in addition to those that correspond to the prokaryotic cognates of the eukaryotic Ub pathway. Other contexts in which JAB domains are present include gene neighbor associations with ubiquitin fold  domains in cysteine and siderophore biosynthesis, and phage tail  morphogenesis, where they are shown or predicted to process the  associated ubiquitin [2,4]. A distinct family, the RadC-like JAB domains are widespread in bacteria and are predicted to function as nucleases [5].

PF14901	Jiv90	Cleavage inducing molecular chaperone	Jiv90 is a fragment of the DnaJ protein in eukaryotes and in J-domain protein interacting with viral protein (Jiv) located in the N terminal region of the pestivirus viral polypeptide.  The viral protein interacts stably with non structural (NS) protein NS2, causing a conformational change in NS2-NS3 and stimulates NS2-NS3 cleavage in trans. Cleavage of NS2-NS3 increases cytopathogenicity and consequently aids viral replication. Jiv therefore acts as a regulating cofactor for NS2 auto-protease. The efficient release of NS3 from the viral polypeptide by Jiv is considered crucial to the pestivirus cytopathogenicity [1]. In eukaryotes, it usually lies 40 residues downstream of DnaJ family Pfam:PF00226. However, the function in eukaryotes is still unknown.	m

Characterisation of BCD proteins shows them to cleave beta-carotene at its central double bond (15,15') to yield two molecules of all-trans-retinal. However, the oxygen atom of retinal originated not from water but from molecular oxygen, suggesting that the enzyme was a beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase, rather than a mono-oxygenase that catalyses the same biochemical reaction [2,3].	y

PF15785	SMG1	Serine/threonine-protein kinase smg-1	SMG1 is a family of eukaryotic proteins. In humans this family acts as an mRNA-surveillance protein [1,2]. In C.elegans, SMG1, a phosphatidylinositol kinase-related protein kinase, is a key regulator of growth.

MKRN1 has been shown to be a a transcriptional co-regulator and an E3 ligase. It functions simultaneously as a differentially negative regulator of p53 and p21, preferentially leading cells to p53-dependent apoptosis by suppressing p21 [3]. The exact function of the C-terminal region has not been determined.	m

PF17990	LodA_N	L-Lysine epsilon oxidase N-terminal	This is the N-terminal domain found in antimicrobial protein (LodA) with lysine-epsilon oxidase activity (EC 1.4.3.20) which is produced by gram-negative marine bacteria such as Marinomonas mediterranea [1]. The enzyme, previously named marinocine, catalyzes the oxidative deamination of l-lysine into 6-semialdehyde 2-aminoadipic acid, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Orthologous proteins have been detected in other bacterial genera, where they participate in biofilm development and dispersal [2]. It has been shown that M. mediterranea LodA and its homologues induce cell death in the microcolonies formed in the process of biofilm development due to the hydrogen peroxide generated by their enzymatic activity. Moreover, cells dispersed from the biofilm by means of this mechanism show a phenotypic variation in growth and biofilm formation. The active form of LodA containing the quinonic cofactor is generated intracellularly only in the presence of LodB, suggesting that the latter protein is involved in this process [3].	y

PF18089	DAPG_hydrolase	DAPG hydrolase PhiG domain	This domain is found in 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol hydrolase PhiG present in Pseudomonas fluorescens. 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol hydrolase is the gene product of PhiG that is responsible for cleaving toxic 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG). The small N-terminal region of the domain is involved in dimerization through hydrogen bonding of the dimer interface. The C-terminal catalytic region resembles the tetracenomycin aromatase/cyclase and has a Bet v1-like fold.

PF18146	CinA_KH	Damage-inducible protein CinA KH domain	This domain is found in competence-induced protein A (CinA) present in Thermus thermophiles. CinA is important in the horizontal transfer of genes via competence and may also participate in the pyridine nucleotide cycle, which recycles products formed by non-redox uses of NAD. This domain has a KH-type fold and contains the absolutely conserved Glu-187, which stabilizes the binding of Mg2+ and hence polarizes the P=O bond for hydrolysis. A major feature of the CinA in T. thermophiles structure is the asymmetry in the dimer, which is caused by contact between a KH-type domain on the opposite chain and the bound ADP-ribose. This has the effect of closing the active site, allowing additional recognition of ADP-ribose by residues from the KH-type domain [1].	u
PF18164	GNAT_C	GNAT-like C-terminal domain	This is the C-terminal domain found in N-acyltransferase (NAT) proteins present in Actinoplanes teichomyceticus.

PnpCD is the key enzyme in the degradation pathway of pollutant para-nitrophenol (PNP). The N-terminal domain residues Trp-76 and Phe-79 are indispensable in the formation of the active site pocket. The N-terminal domain also plays a vital role in formation of the heterotetrameric structure. Structural homologs of the N-terminal domain exhibit the nature to bind nucleic acids but due to the steric effect of the C-terminal domain, this N-terminal domain cannot bind nucleic acids [1].	y
PF18206	Porphyrn_cat_1	Porphyranase catalytic subdomain 1	This domain is found in porphyranase protein present in Bacteroides plebeius. Porphyranase breaks down porphyran during digestion of red seaweed glycans. It is worth noting that red seaweed glycans contain sulfate esters that are absent in terrestrial plants.

Violacein has potential medical applications as an antibacterial, anti-tryptanocidal, anti-ulcerogenic and as an anti-cancer drug. VioE forms a homodimer with a chiefly hydrophobic interface between the two VioE monomers.The fact that VioE adopts a fold normally associated with lipoprotein carrier proteins may be due to VioE for binding the hydrophobic polyethylene glycol [1].	y

Non-native disulfides are corrected by the isomerase DsbC, and, to a lesser extent, by DsbG. The N-terminal domain is involved in dimerization. The dimer interface of Helicobacter pylori's DsbG is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds involving alpha 1, beta-3 to beta-4 loop, beta-4 and beta-4 to alpha-2 loop. This pattern of dimerization is similar to that of E. coli's DsbG [1].	m
PF18269	T3SS_ATPase_C	T3SS EscN ATPase C-terminal domain	This is the C-terminal domain of the EscN protein family of ATPases that form part of the Type III secretion system (T3SS) present in Escherichia coli.

This family is predicted to catalyze peptide ligation reactions on protein substrates in biological conflict contexts, probably between bacteriophages and their hosts [1].	y
PF18365	PI_PP_C	Phosphoinositide phosphatase C-terminal domain	This domain is found in the C-terminal region of effector protein SidP present in Legionella longbeachae. SidP functions as a PI-3-phosphatase specifically hydrolyzing PI(3)P and PI(3,5)P2. This C-terminal domain is rich with glutamate residues [1].	y
PF18370	RGI_lyase	Rhamnogalacturonan I lyases beta-sheet domain  	This is the beta-sheet domain found in rhamnogalacturonan (RG) lyases [1], which are responsible for an initial cleavage of the RG type I (RG-I) region of plant cell wall pectin. Polysaccharide lyase family 11 carrying this domain, such as YesW (EC:4.2.2.23) and YesX (EC:4.2.2.24), cleave glycoside bonds between rhamnose and galacturonic acid residues in RG-I through a beta-elimination reaction [2]. Other family members carrying this domain are hemagglutinin A, lysine gingipain (Kgp) [3] and Chitinase C (EC:3.2.1.14).	s
PF18371	FAD_SOX	Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent sulfhydryl oxidase	This is a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) binding domain found in Quiescin sulfhydryl oxidases (QSOX) (EC:1.8.3.2). QSOX is a multi-domain disulfide catalyst that is localized primarily to the Golgi apparatus and secreted fluids and has attracted attention due to its over-production in tumors. Structural studies indicate that the closure of the Trx1 domain over the FAD-binding site may enhance the active-site chemistry for disulfide formation [1 -3].	y
PF18380	GEN1_C	Holliday junction resolvase Gen1 C-terminal domain	This is the C-terminal domain found in GEN1 resolvase. It is composed of three-strand antiparallel beta sheets and four alpha helices [1]. GEN1 protein, a member of the XPG/Rad2 family of structure-selective endonucleases, is specialized for the cleavage of Holliday junction recombination intermediates [2]. Structural comparison indicates that the C-terminal domain is similar to a series of chromobox homology proteins [1]. Functional analysis indicates that the chromodomain provides an additional DNA binding site necessary for efficient HJ cleavage, and its truncation severely hampers GEN1's catalytic activity [3].	m
PF18391	CHIP_TPR_N	CHIP N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domain	This is N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain found in C terminus of Hsp70 interacting proteins (CHIP). The TPR domain of CHIP binds directly to EEVD motifs located at the C termini of Hsc/Hsp70 and Hsp90 [2].	u

PF18456	CmlA_N	Diiron non-heme beta-hydroxylase N-terminal domain	This is the N-terminal domain found in Diiron non-heme beta-hydroxylase (CmlA). CmlA catalyzes beta-hydroxylation of the precursor molecule l-p-aminophenylalanine (l-PAPA) to form l-p-aminophenylserine. Structural analysis indicate that the N-terminal domain facilitates dimerization and has a mixed alpha-beta topology. Furthermore, a projecting 'dimerization arm' (residues 108-146) from the N-terminal domain of CmlA mediates the interaction between the monomers [1].	y
PF18485	GST_N_5	Glutathione S-transferase, N-terminal domain	This is the N-terminal (GST-N) domain containing a thioredoxin fold. This domain found in methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MRS), a multi-tRNA synthetase complex (MSC) component [1].	y
PF18566	Ldi	Linalool dehydratase/isomerase	This (alpha,alpha)6 barrel fold domain is found in linalool dehydratase/isomerase (Ldi) EC:4.2.1.127 . An enzyme found in the betaproteobacterium Castellaniella defragrans 65Phen that mineralizes monoterpenes coupled to anaerobic denitrification. The periplasmic enzyme reversibly catalyzes the isomerisation from the primary alkenol geraniol into the tertiary alkenol (S)-linalool and its dehydration to beta-myrcene. Each monomer is built up of a classical (alpha,alpha)6 barrel fold composed of six inner helices. Structural data of Ldi revealed the terpene binding site between two monomers inside a hydrophobic channel, and three catalytic clusters involved in catalysis [1].	y
PF18572	T6PP_N	Trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase N-terminal helical bundle domain	This is the N-terminal domain found in trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (T6PP, EC 3.1.3.12) from parasitic nematodes such as Brugia malayi. In the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, T6PP is essential for survival due to the toxic effect(s) of the accumulation of trehalose 6-phosphate. T6PP has also been shown to be essential in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The N-terminal domain composed of a three-helix bundle is similar in topology to the Microtubule Interacting and Transport (MIT) domains of the Vps4-like ATPases from Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. MIT domains are protein-interacting domains typically associated with multivesicular body formation, cytokinetic abscission, or viral budding. Mutational analysis indicate that deletion or mutation of the MIT-like domain is highly destabilizing to the enzyme [1].	y
PF18582	HZS_alpha	Hydrazine synthase alpha subunit middle domain	The crystal structure of hydrazine synthase multiprotein complex isolated from the anammox organism Kuenenia stuttgartiensis implies a two-step mechanism for hydrazine synthesis: a three-electron reduction of nitric oxide to hydroxylamine at the active site of the gamma-subunit and its subsequent condensation with ammonia, yielding hydrazine in the active centre of the alpha-subunit. The alpha-subunit consists of three domains: an N-terminal domain which includes a six-bladed beta-propeller, a middle domain binding a pentacoordinated c-type haem (haem alphaI) and a C-terminal domain which harbours a bis-histidine-coordinated c-type haem (haem alphaII). This entry represents the middle domain of subunit alpha of hydrazine synthase (HZS) [1].	y

PF18626	Gln_deamidase_2	Glutaminase	Protein glutaminase (PG, EC 3.5.1.44) can deamidate glutamine residues in proteins to glutamate residues. This entry represents the mature PG enzyme which bears partial homology to factor XIII-like Transglutaminase (TG), especially its Cys-His-Asp catalytic triad. A similar triad (Cys-His-Asn) is also shared by some cysteine proteases such as papain and actinidin. The mature PG is a monomer enzyme consisting of 185 amino acid residues [1].	y
PF18630	Peptidase_M60_C	Peptidase M60 C-terminal domain	This is C-terminal domain (CTD) of M60-peptidases Pfam:PF13402 [1].  It Can also be found at the C-terminal region of gingipain B (RgpB) from P. gingivalis. It was found to possess a typical Ig-like fold encompassing seven antiparallel beta-strands organized in two beta-sheets, packed into a beta-sandwich structure that can spontaneously dimerise through C-terminal strand swapping. Translocation of gingipains from the periplasm across the OM is dependent on the conserved CTD, which appears to be important for secretion of the proteins and in particular, truncation of the last few C-terminal residues of this domain leads to accumulation of gingipains in the periplasm. Subsequently, the T9SS targeting signal was demonstrated to reside within the last 22 residues at the C-terminus of the CTD. During gingipain translocation across the OM, the CTD is cleaved off by PorU [2].	m

This is the C-terminal domain composed of 5 bundled alpha helices. It is weakly similar to the signal transduction histidine-protein kinase BarA from E. coli and the DNA endonuclease I-MsoI from Monomastix sp [1].	y
PF18637	AUDH_Cupin	Aldos-2-ulose dehydratase/isomerase (AUDH) Cupin domain	The enzyme aldos-2-ulose dehydratase/isomerase (AUDH) participates in carbohydrate secondary metabolism, catalyzing the conversion of glucosone and 1,5-d-anhydrofructose to the secondary metabolites cortalcerone and microthecin, respectively. Crystal structure analysis revealed that the enzyme subunit is built up of three domains, an N-terminal seven-bladed propeller, a bicupin and a C-terminal lectin domain. This entry describes the second Cupin domain (residues 574-739) composed of two antiparallel sheets that build up the jellyroll sandwich fold formed from four and five beta-strands. This cupin domain in AUDH is found to contain a zinc binding site where the metal site is located at the bottom of the cleft formed by the beta-sandwich, as observed in many cupins [1].	y
PF18643	RE_BsaWI	BsaWI restriction endonuclease type 2	Type II restriction endonucleases recognize short 4-8 bp nucleotide sequences and cleave phosphodiester bonds within or close to their target site. BsaWI restriction endonuclease from the thermophilic bacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus W1718 belongs to a group of restriction endonucleases that share CCGG motif within their target sites, termed 'CCGG-family'. However, the R-(D/E)R motif residues, which are supposed to recognize CCGG from the major groove side, are poorly ordered and located far away from the DNA bases. BsaWI contacts with the CCGG tetranucleotide from the minor groove side. It is folded into two domains an N-terminal helical domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain. Furthermore, it carries a PDXKXE motif at the putative active site [1].	m
